# Daytona Documentation

Daytona uses Starlight to manage documentation content. Place your `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/docs/` directory to match the structure above. These files will automatically become available as routes.

Store images in `src/assets/` to include them in your Markdown files with relative link `../../../assets/`.

Place static assets, such as icons and manifest files, into the `public/` directory.

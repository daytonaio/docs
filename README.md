The Daytona Documentation is developed with Astro and Starlight.
Its core architecture leverages React, while documentation content is authored using Markdown (MDX).

## Getting Started

### Using Daytona (Recommended)

The most efficient way to begin working on the documentation is by utilizing a development environment manager (DEM) like Daytona. 
To set up a Workspace with the necessary dependencies and configurations for local preview, run the following command:

```shell
daytona create https://github.com/daytonaio/docs.git
```

### Manual

Alternatively, if Node.js or Yarn are installed and set up on your local machine, you can clone this repository and install the required dependencies and configurations:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/daytonaio/docs.git
```

```shell
yarn install
```

### Useful Commands

This repository utilizes `Yarn` and `npm` to manage project dependencies and custom scripts. Below is a list of commonly used commands, defined in the `package.json`:

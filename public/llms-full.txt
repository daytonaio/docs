Providers are plugins through which Daytona integrates with various technologies to create and manage development environments. Providers abstract complexities of underlying technologies and serve as the foundational engines that Daytona leverages to deploy and run your environments, whether through containerization, orchestration, or cloud-based virtual machines.

Daytona's architecture decentralizes the role of a Provider into a separate service. The [Daytona Server](/docs/usage/server) communicates with Providers to execute operations relating to Workspace creation and lifecycle management.

## Install a Provider

Daytona provides an option to install a Provider to interface with the Daytona Server. Once a new Provider is installed, it manages the Workspace deployment and its lifecycle management.

1. Run the following command to install a Provider:

```shell
daytona provider install
```

:::note
Daytona will prompt you select a [Runner](/docs/usage/runners) to manage the Provider.

title: Workspace Templates
description: Learn how to manage and reuse Workspaces Templates across multiple Workspaces.
---


<Label>
  Distribution: **Open Source**
</Label>

A Workspace Template is designed to simplify the management of development environments, allowing you to predefine settings that can be easily applied to any new Workspace.

A Workspace Template contains all necessary properties to define and manage Workspaces within a Workspace. It stores information such as the repository URL, build configuration, and environment variables. This allows for easy reuse of previously set templates, ensuring a consistent and reproducible setup across multiple Workspaces.

A Workspace Template encapsulates all the essential elements for setting up a Workspace, including:

- **Repository URL**

   The URL of the Git repository associated with the Workspace.

- **Build Configuration**

   [Automatic](/docs/usage/builders#automatic) auto-detects the most appropriate Builder for your Workspace.

   [Devcontainer](/docs/usage/builders#dev-container) utilizes a predefined development container specified by a `devcontainer.json` file.

   [Custom image](/docs/usage/builders#custom-image) builds the Workspace image by specifying a custom base container.

   [None](/docs/usage/builders#none) builds a Workspace by using the default base image (`daytonaio/workspace-project`).

- **Environment Variables**

   Environment variables are specified in the `KEY=VALUE` format. These variables are essential for the Workspace's build and runtime environments. You can set the variables directly or pass them from the machine's environment during execution.

- **Workspace Template name**

   A unique identifier for the Workspace Template, which distinguishes it from other Template within the system.

With the `daytona workspace-template` command, you can add, view, update, list, set as default, or delete Workspace Templates, giving you full control over the Template and reuse of your Workspace setups across different Workspaces.

## Create a Workspace Template

Daytona provides an option to add a Workspace Template, enabling you to store and reuse Workspace properties across multiple Workspaces.

1. Run the following command to add a Workspace Template:

```shell
daytona workspace-template add
```

2. Select one of the two provided options available for creating a Workspace Template:

- **Enter a custom repository URL**

   An option to enter a custom repository URL manually if the repository is not listed under your Git Provider account or is from an external source.

- **Create from Sample**

   If you do not have a Git repository ready, you can create a Workspace Template from a Sample project provided by Daytona.

3. Enter the repository URL of the Workspace you want to configure, or select to create a Workspace Template from a sample project.

```text
Git repository
>
```

4. Enter a name for the Workspace Template.

```text
Name
>
```

5. Select the build configuration for the Workspace.

```text
Choose a build configuration
Automatic
Devcontainer
Custom image
None
```

6. Enter the environment variables for the Workspace in the **`KEY=VALUE`** format.

```text
Environment Variables
Enter environment variables in the format KEY=VALUE
To pass machine env variables at runtime, use $VALUE
```

Upon completion, Daytona will output a summary of the Workspace Template, enabling you to review the properties before saving it.

```text

title: Telemetry
description: Information about telemetry data gathered by Daytona.
sidebar:
  label: Telemetry
---


<Label>
  Distribution: **Open Source**, **Self-Managed**
</Label>

All telemetry data is **completely anonymous** and **does not** include any personally identifiable information (PII) or user secrets.
Participation is optional and you may opt-out at any time.

## The Goal

The goal of gathering telemetry data in the CLI is exclusively for the purpose of improving the Daytona ecosystem.
Data gathered from the CLI will allow us to gain more insights into the usage of the binary, help us track errors and improve user experience.

The data **does** include:

- **CLI command usage**

  This includes the name of the command that was run, how it was called (e.g., was an alias used?),
  the source (e.g., local CLI or inside of a project), the version of the binary, and the execution time.

- **API server request and response data**

  In the request and response payloads, only public data is included.
  This data may include any public git repositories used to create workspaces and any public container images used to create workspaces.

  The data also includes the path of the request, with URL parameters that might include PII stripped (e.g., URI: `/workspace/:workspaceId/:projectName/state` is provided as is,
  with `workspaceId` and `projectName` not provided to the telemetry service).
  Additionally, the request method, binary version, query, and source are gathered.

- **Relevant server events**

  Currently, only workspace lifecycle events are gathered (creation, stop, start, delete, etc.), but this might be expanded in the future.

The data **does not** include:

- **CLI command arguments**

  Arguments might contain PII or user secrets, so they are left out.

- **Full API request and response payloads**

  Payloads may contain PII or user secrets, so only public data is shared with the telemetry collection service.

- **Environment variables**

  Any environment variables set on projects created by the user, including Daytona-set environment variables, are not included.

- **Geolocation information and IP address**

  No geolocation information about the user or their IP address is included.

## Gathering Policy

Telemetry gathering in the CLI is **opt-out**. This means that telemetry data is gathered by default because it does not include any PII.

- To disable telemetry, users can run `daytona telemetry disable`.

- To enable telemetry, users can run `daytona telemetry enable`.

## CLI Identifier

All telemetry events contain a unique identifier. The ID is set in the CLI configuration.
The purpose of this identifier is to provide a way to aggregate telemetry data from the same CLI across different sessions and workspaces.
This means that the CLI ID is shared between the CLI and any workspaces the user might create.

## Data Protection

We use <a href="https://posthog.com/" target="_blank">Posthog</a> as our Telemetry service of choice.
The data is stored in the EU under the Daytona organization account.
The data is available only to a subset of Daytona maintainers and is only used for the purpose of improving the Daytona ecosystem.
The telemetry data that we track has never and will never be sold or monetized in any form.

## Debugging

Telemetry events can be debugged by setting `LOG_LEVEL=trace` which will output information about the telemetry event queue.

You can use the following troubleshooting tips to resolve common issues with Daytona.

## Connectivity Issues

### VPNs and Firewalls

If your VPN is configured to handle all IP traffic or if your Firewall is configured to block certain IP addresses, they may prevent Daytona from successfully connecting to the reverse proxy service.
The issue can be manifested in different ways, including:

- Unable to start the Daytona Server due to the `control not running` error.
- Unable to successfully create Workspaces due to the `Failed to connect to server: Get "http://server/health": lookup server...` error.
- Unable to enter a Workspace using `daytona code` or `daytona ssh` due to the timeout when establishing a Tailscale connection.

To work around this issue, you may need to add the following IP address exceptions to your VPN or Firewall:

- `35.198.165.62` - Europe-based reverse proxy
- `34.133.75.4` - US-based reverse proxy

## WSL2 with Visual Studio Code

### Description

Running Daytona on WSL2 does not work seamlessly with the Visual Studio Code IDE. This issue arises because Visual Studio Code relies on the native Windows SSH client, whereas Daytona modifies the Linux SSH configuration file to set up workspace-specific SSH connection configurations.

Daytona uses a ProxyCommand that invokes `daytona ssh-proxy` as defined in the SSH configuration. This configuration assumes that the Daytona binary is located within the Linux filesystem, which creates a conflict with Visual Studio Code's reliance on the Windows environment.

This issue is not specific to Daytona but rather stems from a limitation in the Visual Studio Code remote development plugin. The plugin does not currently support passing a custom "remote SSH path" flag when invoking the `code` CLI. Without this feature, Daytona's reliance on Linux-specific configurations conflicts with Visual Studio Code's dependency on Windows-native tools.

### Solution

While awaiting official support for a "remote SSH path" flag in the Visual Studio Code plugin, the following workaround can address the issue. This solution involves creating a script and modifying configurations to align the Windows and Linux SSH clients for seamless operation.

1. Create a **`wsl_ssh.bat`** script with the following content:

```bash
C:\Windows\system32\wsl.exe ssh %*
```

2. Save the **`wsl_ssh.bat`** script in the following directory:

```text
C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Roaming\bin\wsl_ssh.bat
```

3. Update the Visual Studio Code **`settings.json`** file to use the **`wsl_ssh.bat`** script as the SSH path:

```sh
"remote.SSH.path": "C:\\Users\\<USERNAME>\\AppData\\Roaming\\bin\\wsl_ssh.bat"
```

:::tip
The `settings.json` file is located in the following directory:

`C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\settings.json`
:::

<br />

4. Create a symlink to synchronize the native SSH configuration with the WSL2 SSH configuration:

```sh
ln -s /mnt/c/Users/<USERNAME>/.ssh/config config
```

This ensures the SSH configuration is consistent between environments.

The Daytona SDK provides flexible configuration options to customize its behavior and connection settings.

## Configuration Options

Daytona SDK provides an option to configure settings using the `DaytonaConfig` class in Python and TypeScript. The `DaytonaConfig` class accepts the following parameters:

- `api_key`: Your Daytona API key
- `server_url`: URL of your Daytona server
- `target`: Daytona Target to create the Workspaces on.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Python" icon="seti:python">
```python
from daytona_sdk import DaytonaConfig

config = DaytonaConfig(
    api_key="your-api-key",
    server_url="your-server-url",
    target="local"
)

```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="TypeScript" icon="seti:typescript">
```typescript
import { DaytonaConfig } from '@daytonaio/sdk';

const config: DaytonaConfig = {
    apiKey: "your-api-key",          
    serverUrl: "your-server-url",     
    target: "local"                  
};
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Environment Variables

Daytona SDK supports environment variables for configuration. The SDK automatically looks for these environment variables:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **`DAYTONA_API_KEY`** | Your Daytona API key. | None |
| **`DAYTONA_SERVER_URL`** | URL of your Daytona server. | None |
| **`DAYTONA_TARGET`** | Daytona Target to create the Workspaces on. | "local" |

### Setting Environment Variables

Daytona SDK can read configuration from environment variables. You can set these environment variables using the following methods:

- [Using a **`.env`** file](#using-a-env-file)
- [Using Shell Environment](#using-shell-environment)

#### Using a **`.env`** File

Create a `.env` file in your project root directory:

```bash
DAYTONA_API_KEY=your-api-key
DAYTONA_SERVER_URL=https://your-server-url
DAYTONA_TARGET=local
```

- `DAYTONA_API_KEY`: Your Daytona API key.
- `DAYTONA_SERVER_URL`: URL of your Daytona server.
- `DAYTONA_TARGET`: Daytona Target to create the Workspaces on.

#### Using Shell Environment

Set environment variables in your shell:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Bash/Zsh" icon="seti:shell">
```bash
export DAYTONA_API_KEY=your-api-key
export DAYTONA_SERVER_URL=https://your-server-url
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Windows PowerShell" icon="seti:powershell">
```bash
$env:DAYTONA_API_KEY="your-api-key"
$env:DAYTONA_SERVER_URL="https://your-server-url"
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Configuration Precedence

The SDK uses the following precedence order for configuration (highest to lowest):

1. Explicitly passed configuration in code.
2. Environment variables.
3. Configuration file.
4. Default values.

}

```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Best Practices

Daytona SDK provides best practices for process and code execution in Workspaces.

1. **Resource Management**

- Use sessions for long-running operations
- Clean up sessions after execution
- Handle session exceptions properly

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Python" icon="seti:python">
   ```python
   # Python - Clean up session
   try:
       session_id = workspace.process.create_session("long-running-cmd")
       # Do work...
   finally:
       workspace.process.delete_session(session_id)
   ```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="TypeScript" icon="seti:typescript">
   ```typescript
   // TypeScript - Clean up processes
   try {
       const sessionId = await workspace.process.createSession("long-running-cmd");
       // Do work...
   } finally {
       await workspace.process.deleteSession(processId);
   }
   ```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

2. **Error Handling**

- Handle process exceptions properly
- Log error details for debugging
- Use try-catch blocks for error handling

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Python" icon="seti:python">
```python
try:
    response = workspace.process.code_run("invalid python code")
except ProcessExecutionError as e:
    print(f"Execution failed: {e}")
    print(f"Exit code: {e.exit_code}")
    print(f"Error output: {e.stderr}")
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="TypeScript" icon="seti:typescript">
```typescript
try {
    const response = await workspace.process.codeRun("invalid typescript code");
} catch (e) {
    if (e instanceof ProcessExecutionError) {
        console.error("Execution failed:", e);
        console.error("Exit code:", e.exitCode);
        console.error("Error output:", e.stderr);
    }
}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

title: Builders
description: A reference detailing how to use Dev Containers and custom images as the base for your project.
sidebar:
  label: Builders
---


<Label>
  Distribution: **Open Source**
</Label>


Builders are responsible for creating a container image with the necessary tools and configurations for your [Project](/docs/usage/projects).
Daytona provides control over how the resulting Project environment is created, allowing you to choose your preferred method to build the Project image.

You can choose between the following Builders while [creating a Workspace](/docs/usage/workspaces#create-a-workspace):

- [**Automatic**](#automatic)

   Daytona builds the Project image after auto-detecting the most appropriate Builder.

- [**Dev Container**](#dev-container)

   Daytona builds the Project image according to the Dev Container configuration located in the project.

- [**Custom Image**](#custom-image)

   Daytona builds the Project image using an image you specify.

- [**None**](#none)

   Daytona creates the Project using the default base image.

## Automatic

Daytona can auto-detect the most appropriate Builder for your Project. Daytona uses the following logic to determine which Builder to use:

1. Check if a Dev Container configuration is present in **`.devcontainer.json`** or **`.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`**, relative to the repository root.
2. If present, use the [Dev Container](#dev-container) Builder. If not present, use the [None](#none) Builder.

To use the Automatic Builder, set the `--builder` flag value to `auto` during the [Workspace creation](/docs/usage/workspaces#create-a-workspace). This flag only applies when creating Workspaces with a single Project.

```shell
daytona create <REPO_URL> --builder=auto
```

## Dev Container

Development Containers (Dev Containers) provide a consistent and fully featured development environments for your [Projects](/docs/usage/projects). A Dev Container defines all the necessary tools, runtime, and environment configurations required to build and run your Projects.

The Dev Container specification is designed to define a development environment that can be replicated across different platforms and CI/CD systems. The specification is defined within a `devcontainer.json` file in the project repository.

The `devcontainer.json` file is a JSON file that consists of components that define the development environment. The file includes objects with properties containing metadata and settings required to configurate a development container. View the [dev container specification](https://containers.dev/implementors/json_reference/) for more information.

Use [devcontainer.ai](https://devcontainer.ai/) to generate a `devcontainer.json` file for your Project.

Example `devcontainer.json` file:

```sh
{
    "name": "Example Python & PostgreSQL Dev Container",
    "build": {
        "dockerfile": "Dockerfile",
        "args": {
            "VARIANT": "3.8",
            "INSTALL_NODE": "false"
        }
    },
    "settings": {
        "terminal.integrated.shell.linux": "/bin/bash"
    },
    "extensions": [
        "ms-python.python",
        "ms-azuretools.vscode-docker"
    ],
    "postCreateCommand": "pip install -r requirements.txt",
    "remoteUser": "vscode"
}
```

- `name`: The name of the development container.
- `build`: The build configuration for the development container.
- `settings`: The settings for the development container.
- `extensions`: The extensions to install in the development container.
- `postCreateCommand`: The command to run after creating the development container.
- `remoteUser`: The user to execute commands as during the image build process.

Daytona provides the option to build the Project image using the Dev Container standard. Use the following option available when using the Dev Container Builder:

- **Devcontainer file path**

   The path where the Dev Container configuration is located, relative to the repository root.
   The default value is `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`.

To use the Dev Container Builder, set the `--devcontainer-path` flag to the Dev Container configuration path within the repository during the [Workspace creation](/docs/usage/workspaces#create-a-workspace). This flag only applies when creating Workspaces with a single Project.

```shell showLineNumbers
daytona create <REPO_URL> --devcontainer-path=.devcontainer/devcontainer.json
```

:::note
For more information on the Dev Container standard, refer to the official documentation at [containers.dev](https://containers.dev/).
:::

## Custom Image

You can build the Project image by specifying a custom base container.
The following options are accepted when using this Builder:

- **Custom container image**

   The name of the base container image for the Project.

- **Container user**

   The user to execute commands as during the image build process.

- **Environment variables**

   A list of environment variables in the format `KEY=VALUE`.

To use the Custom Image Builder, set both `--custom-image` and `--custom-image-user` flags while [creating a Workspace](/docs/usage/workspaces#create-a-workspace). These flags only apply when creating Workspaces with a single Project.

```shell
daytona create <REPO_URL> --custom-image=daytona-workspace:latest --custom-image-user=daytona
```

## None

Daytona can build a Project using the default base image.

Unless otherwise configured using `daytona server configure`, the default base image is set to `daytonaio/workspace-project`.

## Custom Build Registry

You can set a custom build registry for images built by a Daytona Builder.
After an image is built, it will be uploaded to the configured container registry to speed up future Workspace creation for the same Project.

**Prerequisite**

- An account on an accessible container registry with permission to push/pull images.

1. Execute the following command to configure the custom build registry:

```shell
daytona container-registry set
```

2. Set the required options:

- **Server URL**

   The full URL to your custom container registry.

- **Username**

   The username Daytona should use to log in to the container registry.

- **Password**

   The password for your container registry account.

3. Press <Keyboard shortcuts="Enter" /> to set the custom build registry.
4. Execute the following command to configure the server:

```shell
daytona server configure
```

5. Press <Keyboard shortcuts="Enter" /> until the "Builder Registry" section is highlighted.

```text
Builder Registry
To add options, add a container registry with 'daytona cr set'
> Local registry managed by Daytona
```

6. Select the custom registry configured previously using <Keyboard shortcuts="↑" /> / <Keyboard shortcuts="↓" /> arrow keys.
7. Press <Keyboard shortcuts="Enter" /> until the command exits to save the configuration.

<Label>
  Distribution: **Open Source**
</Label>

Prebuilds are designed to accelerate development by pre-building your Workspace. When you start a Workspace, the prebuilt environment is used, ensuring that the Workspace is initiated almost instantly.

Prebuilds achieve this by setting up a [project configuration](/docs/usage/projects#project-configuration) that monitors changes in the connected Git Provider's repository.

Prebuilds work by registering a listener for webhook events from the Git Provider. A public API endpoint is provided, which the Git Provider uses to send these requests.

:::note
Daytona currently supports GitHub, GitLab, and GitLab Self-Managed as Git Providers for Prebuilds.
:::

## Add a Prebuild

1. Run the following command to add a new Prebuild:

```shell
daytona prebuilds add
```

Upon running the command, Daytona will prompt you to select a project configuration you plan to work on. You can then decide on a commit interval (e.g. `5`, _every 5 commits_) after which a build should be triggered, any specific trigger files whose changes should immediately start the build process, and build retention (the maximum number of builds to store at a time).

```

```text
Trigger Files
Enter full paths for files whose changes you want to explicitly trigger a prebuild. Use new lines for multiple entries.
```

```text
Retention
Maximum number of resulting builds stored at a time

```

Subsequent `daytona create` calls will automatically detect the most recent existing build and use it to create the project.

## Use a Prebuild

Once you added a Prebuild, it becomes active immediately based on the [project configuration](/docs/usage/projects#project-configuration) you provided. The Prebuild will automatically run whenever the specified conditions are met, such as when the defined number of commits is reached.

For instance, if you specified a commit interval of `5`, the Prebuild will run after every `5` commits to the repository. Populate the **Trigger files** field with files whose changes you want to immediately trigger a Prebuild, without having to wait for the commit interval. Use the **Retention** field to define how many successful builds you want Daytona to remember (defaults to `3`).

As soon as you add a Prebuild, a build process will automatically start in the background unless you have configured it otherwise. The initial build process may take some time to complete, but subsequent builds will be significantly faster. You can view the initial build's progress by running `daytona builds list`.

Once the build process is complete, run the following command to create a Workspace using the configured project configuration:

```shell
daytona create [PROJECT_CONFIG_NAME]
```

Upon running this command, Daytona will detect the most recent Prebuild associated with the selected project configuration. The Workspace will then use this Prebuild, significantly speeding up the setup process by utilizing the cached environment

During the Workspace creation process, if the initial Prebuild has finished, the setup will be almost instantaneous. Otherwise, a new build will be triggered, potentially slowing down the Workspace creation.

## List Prebuilds

Daytona provides an option to list all Prebuilds, providing you with an overview of the properties stored within each Prebuild configuration.

1. Run the following command to list all Prebuilds:

```shell

title: Runners
description: Learn how to use and manage Runners in Daytona.
---

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

A Runner is a standalone service that can be deployed anywhere. The user can deploy a Runner on a target system by executing a set of instructions and commands generated upon Runner registration.

Once deployed, the Runner starts up and connects to the [Daytona Server](/docs/usage/server), at which point its status is marked as `Running`.

The Runner sends all requests, while the Server only responds. The Runner sends requests such as _Heartbeat_ (to share its status) and _Job Requests_ (to ask Daytona Server for jobs assigned to it).

A single Runner can use multiple [Providers](/docs/configuration/providers), configured during deployment or later via jobs, enabling flexibility for various environments.

## Create a Runner

Daytona provides an option to create a new Runner, enabling you to deploy it on a target system and connect it to the Daytona Server.

1. Run the following command to create a new Runner:

title: Samples
description: Learn how to create and manage samples in Daytona.
sidebar:
  label: Samples
---

import Keyboard from "../../../components/Keyboard.astro"

<Label>
  Distribution: **Open Source**, **Cloud**, **Self-Managed**
</Label>

Samples are quick-start repositories with predefined development configurations, environments, and dependencies used to create Workspaces.

## Custom Samples

Daytona provides an option to use custom Samples to create Workspaces. Creating custom Samples is a two-step process that involves:

- [**Sample Repository**](#sample-repository)

    A repository containing the Sample code and a `devcontainer.json` file defining the development environment.

- [**Samples Index**](#samples-index)

    Samples Index (`index.json`) file serving as a registry of available Samples for creating Workspaces.

### Sample Repository

Custom Sample repository is a Git repository that contains the Sample code and a `devcontainer.json` file that defines the development environment. The repository serves as the core content of the Sample and is used to create a Workspace.

1. Create a repository representing the custom Sample.

2. Define the custom Sample code, development configurations and dependencies.

3. Create a **`devcontainer.json`** file that defines the development environment.

- Use the [development container standard](https://containers.dev/) to define your development environment. Development containers vary based on the programming language, configurations, and tools used within the Sample.

Example of a **`devcontainer.json`** file for development environment using Go programming language:

```json
{
    "name": "Go",
    "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/go:1-1.21-bookworm",
    "customizations": {
        "vscode": {
            "extensions": [
                "golang.Go"
            ]
        }
    },
    "postCreateCommand": "go test -v"
}
```

4. Host the Sample repository on a Git repository or another platform.

5. Add Sample properties to the [Samples Index](#samples-index).

Sample will be used to create a Workspace by cloning the repository and using the `devcontainer.json` file to define the development environment.

### Samples Index

Samples require a Sample Index (`index.json`) file that serves as a registry of available Samples for creating Workspaces. The Samples Index is used to display the available Samples when creating a Workspace.

1. Create an **`index.json`** file representing the Samples Index.

2. Define an array of JSON objects representing the Samples.

    Each JSON object in the array represents a Sample:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "My Custom Sample",
    "description": "My custom Samples description",
    "gitUrl": "https://github.com/<username>/<repository>"
  }
]
```

- **`name`**

    Name of the Sample.

- **`gitUrl`**

    Link to the publicly available Sample repository.

3. Host the **`index.json`** file publicly on a Git repository or another platform.

4. Run the following command to configure the Samples Index URL:

```sh
daytona server configure
```

5. Enter the public raw URL of the **`index.json`** file in the **`Samples Index URL`** field.

```text
Samples Index URL
Leave empty to disable samples
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<username>/<repository>/<path>/index.json
```

```text
Server configuration updated. You need to restart the server for the changes to take effect.
```

6. Restart the Daytona server to apply the changes.

```sh
daytona server restart
```

Custom Samples will be available available when creating a Workspace. The chosen Sample will be cloned and used to create the Workspace.

## Daytona Samples

Daytona provides a collection of default Samples with predefined development configurations, environments, and dependencies. Daytona Samples are available to choose from when [creating a Workspace](/usage/workspaces#create-a-workspace).

Daytona Samples are integrated via a Samples Index (`index.json`) file that serves as a registry of available Daytona Samples for creating Workspaces.

The chosen Sample will be cloned and used to create the Workspace. The Daytona Sample repository will serve as the core content of the Sample used to create a Workspace.

View the list of available Daytona Samples in the [Samples Index](https://github.com/daytonaio/daytona/blob/main/hack/samples/index.json).

:::tip
You can contribute to the Daytona Samples by suggesting new Samples to be added to the [Daytona Samples Index](https://github.com/daytonaio/daytona/blob/main/hack/samples/index.json).

<Label>
  Distribution: **Open Source**, **Cloud**, **Self-Managed**
</Label>

Workspaces are isolated development environments containing your project’s codebase, dependencies, packages, and configuration, providing a consistent and reproducible setup for development, testing, and deployment.

Workspaces serve as a core component of Daytona, allowing you to create, manage, and collaborate on projects in a controlled and secure environment.

Workspaces are hosted using a suitable [Target](/docs/usage/targets) infrastructure, such as a cloud-based and on-premises environments. They ensure that changes in one project do not inadvertently affect another, promoting a more stable and reliable workflow. This is particularly beneficial in collaborative settings, as it ensures that all team members are working with the same configuration, reducing the likelihood of environment-related issues.

## Create a Workspace

Creating a Workspace in Daytona is a straightforward process that ensures you have a dedicated development environment for your projects.

Daytona provides two primary methods for creating a Workspace:

- [**From a Git Repository**](#from-a-git-repository)
- [**From an Arbitrary Git URL**](#from-an-arbitrary-git-url)

### From a Git Repository

Creating a Workspace from a Git repository sets up a new development environment using a [connected Git Provider](/docs/configuration/git-providers) or a custom Git repository URL.

1. Run the following command to create a Workspace from a Git repository:

```shell
daytona create
```

<Aside type="tip">
Skip automatically opening the Workspace in an [IDE](/docs/usage/ide) by using the `--no-ide` flag.

```shell
daytona create --no-ide
```

</Aside>

<br />

2. Select one of the three provided options:

- **Select from a List of Repositories**

   If you [connected a Git Provider](/docs/configuration/git-providers), you will be presented with a list of your repositories from which you can select to connect with your Workspace.

- **Enter a Custom Repository URL**

   Alternatively, select the option to enter a custom repository URL manually if the repository is not listed under your Git Provider account or is from an external source.

- **Create from Sample**

   If you do not have a Git repository ready, you can create a Workspace from a Sample project provided by Daytona. This option sets up a new development environment using quick-start templates.

```text
Choose a Git Provider
3 items
===
GitHub
Enter a custom repository URL
Create from Sample
```

3. Enter a name for your Workspace.

```text
Workspace name
>
```

<Aside type="tip">
   Press `F10` to configure advanced settings for your Workspace,
   including setting the [Builder](/docs/usage/builders).
</Aside>

<br />

4. Select a Target to deploy your Workspace to. Selecting a Target will prompt you to input the [Target configuration](/docs/configuration/target-config). The configurations vary based on the selected Target.

Upon Target selection and configuration, Daytona will clone the specified Git repository and set up a new Workspace based on its contents. You will see progress information in the terminal, indicating the process of creating a Workspace.

```text
<Target>    | ✓ Request submitted
<Workspace> | Creating workspace <workspace> (<workspace_id>)
<Workspace> | Pulling image...
<Workspace> | Pulling from daytonaio/workspace-project
<Workspace> | Digest: sha256:<sha256>
<Workspace> | Status: Image is up to date for daytonaio/workspace-project:latest
<Workspace> | ✓ Image pulled successfully
<Workspace> | UIDs and GIDs are the same (1000:1000).
<Workspace> | Cloning into '/workdir/<workspace>'...
<Workspace> | UIDs and GIDs are the same (1000:1000).
<Workspace> | ✓ Workspace <workspace> created
```

### From an Arbitrary Git URL

Creating a Workspace from an arbitrary Git URL sets up a new development environment by directly specifying the URL of the remote repository.

1. Run the following command to create a Workspace from a remote Git repository:

```shell
daytona create <REPO_URL>
```

**Example**

```shell
daytona create https://github.com/daytonaio/daytona.git
```

2. Select a Target to deploy your Workspace to. Selecting a Target will prompt you to input the [Target configuration](/docs/configuration/target-config). The configurations vary based on the selected Target.

Upon Target selection and configuration, Daytona will clone the specified Git repository and set up a new Workspace based on its contents. You will see progress information in the terminal, indicating the process of creating a Workspace.

Once complete, the Workspace will be ready for use with the specified repository and configuration.

```text
<Target>    | ✓ Request submitted
<Workspace> | Creating workspace <workspace> (<workspace_id>)
<Workspace> | Pulling image...
<Workspace> | Pulling from daytonaio/workspace-project
<Workspace> | Digest: sha256:<sha256>
<Workspace> | Status: Image is up to date for daytonaio/workspace-project:latest
<Workspace> | ✓ Image pulled successfully
<Workspace> | UIDs and GIDs are the same (1000:1000).
<Workspace> | Cloning into '/workdir/<workspace>'...
<Workspace> | UIDs and GIDs are the same (1000:1000).
<Workspace> | ✓ Workspace <workspace> created
```

<Aside type="tip">

Upon running this command, Daytona will establish a port forwarding connection from the specified port in the Workspace to your local machine. The terminal will display a message indicating the local port where the forwarded connection is available:

```text
Port available at http://localhost:4321
```

### Access a Port via Public URL

You can access services running in a Workspace via a generated public URL.
This allows you to share your work with others in real-time.

This feature uses a free public proxy service hosted by Daytona Platforms, Inc.

:::

**Prerequisite**

- A running Workspace with at least one service accessible via TCP/UDP.

1. Run the following command to generate a public URL for a port on a running Workspace:

```shell
daytona forward <PORT> <WORKSPACE> <PROJECT> --public
```

**Example:** Generate a URL to access port 4321 of the `example-dev-env` Workspace.

```shell
daytona forward 4321 example-dev-env --public
```

Upon running this command, Daytona will first establish a local port forwarding connection and display a message indicating the local port where the forwarded connection is available.

```text
Port available at http://localhost:4321
```

Then, Daytona will proceed to forward the port to a public URL. The terminal will display progress information and, upon completion, provide the generated public URL.

```text
Forwarding port to a public URL...
Port available at:
https://4321-ABC1DeF2GhI3JkLmNoP4RSTuVZ5.try-eu.daytona.app
```

This URL can be shared with others to provide real-time access to the service running on the specified port in your Workspace.

<Aside type="tip">
Alternatively, generate a public URL by executing the following command in a Workspace's shell:

<br />

```shell
daytona forward <PORT>
```

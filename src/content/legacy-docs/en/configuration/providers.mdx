Providers are plugins through which Daytona integrates with various technologies to create and manage development environments. Providers abstract complexities of underlying technologies and serve as the foundational engines that Daytona leverages to deploy and run your environments, whether through containerization, orchestration, or cloud-based virtual machines.

Daytona's architecture decentralizes the role of a Provider into a separate service. The [Daytona Server](/docs/en/usage/server) communicates with Providers to execute operations relating to Workspace creation and lifecycle management.

## Install a Provider

Daytona provides an option to install a Provider to interface with the Daytona Server. Once a new Provider is installed, it manages the Workspace deployment and its lifecycle management.

1. Run the following command to install a Provider:

```shell
daytona provider install
```

:::note
Daytona will prompt you select a [Runner](/docs/en/usage/runners) to manage the Provider.

2. Select the Provider you want to install from the list or select a specific version.

```text

:::note
Ensure the Azure Provider is linked to a service principal with the `Contributor` role for the appropriate Azure subscription.
<br />
To create a service principal with the `Contributor` role, use the following Azure CLI command:
<br />

```shell
az ad sp create-for-rbac --role Contributor --scopes /subscriptions/<subscription-id>
```

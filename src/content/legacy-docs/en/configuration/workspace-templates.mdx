A Workspace Template is designed to simplify the management of development environments, allowing you to predefine settings that can be easily applied to any new Workspace.

A Workspace Template contains all necessary properties to define and manage Workspaces within a Workspace. It stores information such as the repository URL, build configuration, and environment variables. This allows for easy reuse of previously set templates, ensuring a consistent and reproducible setup across multiple Workspaces.

A Workspace Template encapsulates all the essential elements for setting up a Workspace, including:

- **Repository URL**

   The URL of the Git repository associated with the Workspace.

- **Build Configuration**

   [Automatic](/docs/en/usage/builders#automatic) auto-detects the most appropriate Builder for your Workspace.

   [Devcontainer](/docs/en/usage/builders#dev-container) utilizes a predefined development container specified by a `devcontainer.json` file.

   [Custom image](/docs/en/usage/builders#custom-image) builds the Workspace image by specifying a custom base container.

   [None](/docs/en/usage/builders#none) builds a Workspace by using the default base image (`daytonaio/workspace-project`).

- **Environment Variables**

   Environment variables are specified in the `KEY=VALUE` format. These variables are essential for the Workspace's build and runtime environments. You can set the variables directly or pass them from the machine's environment during execution.

- **Workspace Template name**

   A unique identifier for the Workspace Template, which distinguishes it from other Template within the system.

With the `daytona workspace-template` command, you can add, view, update, list, set as default, or delete Workspace Templates, giving you full control over the Template and reuse of your Workspace setups across different Workspaces.

## Create a Workspace Template

Daytona provides an option to add a Workspace Template, enabling you to store and reuse Workspace properties across multiple Workspaces.

1. Run the following command to add a Workspace Template:

```shell
daytona workspace-template add
```

2. Select one of the two provided options available for creating a Workspace Template:

- **Enter a custom repository URL**

   An option to enter a custom repository URL manually if the repository is not listed under your Git Provider account or is from an external source.

- **Create from Sample**

   If you do not have a Git repository ready, you can create a Workspace Template from a Sample project provided by Daytona.

3. Enter the repository URL of the Workspace you want to configure, or select to create a Workspace Template from a sample project.

```text
Git repository
>
```

4. Enter a name for the Workspace Template.

```text
Name
>
```

5. Select the build configuration for the Workspace.

```text
Choose a build configuration
Automatic
Devcontainer
Custom image
None
```

6. Enter the environment variables for the Workspace in the **`KEY=VALUE`** format.

```text
Environment Variables
Enter environment variables in the format KEY=VALUE
To pass machine env variables at runtime, use $VALUE
```

Upon completion, Daytona will output a summary of the Workspace Template, enabling you to review the properties before saving it.

```text
SUMMARY - Workspace Template

Workspace - MyWorkspace
Repository  https://github.com/daytonaio/docs
Branch      main 
Build       Automatic
Image       daytonaio/workspace-project:latest
User        daytona
```

7. Click **`Create`** to save the Workspace Template, or **`Configure`** to make changes to the Workspace Template.

```text

Upon running this command, Daytona will display a list of your Workspace Templates. You will be able to view the Workspace Template name, the repository URL it is connected to, the build configuration, and if it is set as a default Template.

```text
Name                 Repository           Build            Default
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
MyWorkspaceConfig    daytonaio/daytona    Devcontainer     Yes
```

## Update Workspace Template

Daytona provides an option to update an existing Workspace Template, enabling you to modify the properties stored within it.

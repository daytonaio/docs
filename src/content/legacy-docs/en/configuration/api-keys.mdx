Daytona API keys are used to authenticate requests to the [Daytona API](/docs/en/tools/api). Daytona provides an option to generate an API key for managing your API requests, list all generated API keys, and revoke an API key.

## Generate an API Key

Daytona provides an option to generate API keys.

1. Run the following command to generate an API key:

```bash
daytona api-key generate
```

Upon running this command, Daytona will prompt you to enter a name for the API key.

```text

>
```

Upon successful generation of the API key, Daytona will display the following confirmation message:

```text
You have successfully generated a new API Key and Server URL, which you can find below:

DAYTONA_API_KEY=your-api-key
DAYTONA_SERVER_URL=your-server-url
```

Daytona provides an option to connect to the Daytona Server instantly from a client machine by running the following command:

```bash
daytona profile add -a <your-server-url> -k <your-api-key>
```

## List API Keys

Daytona provides an option to list all generated API keys.

1. Run the following command to list all generated API keys:

```bash
daytona api-key list
```

Upon running this command, Daytona will display the list of all generated API keys.

```text

──────────────────────────────────────────

## Revoke an API Key

Daytona provides an option to revoke API keys.

3. Press **`Enter`** on the selected API key to revoke it.

4. Confirm the revocation by selecting **`Yes`** or **`No`**.

```

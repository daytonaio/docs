Builders are responsible for creating a container image with the necessary tools and configurations for your [Project](/docs/en/usage/projects).
Daytona provides control over how the resulting Project environment is created, allowing you to choose your preferred method to build the Project image.

You can choose between the following Builders while [creating a Workspace](/docs/en/usage/workspaces#create-a-workspace):

- [**Automatic**](#automatic)

   Daytona builds the Project image after auto-detecting the most appropriate Builder.

- [**Dev Container**](#dev-container)

   Daytona builds the Project image according to the Dev Container configuration located in the project.

- [**Custom Image**](#custom-image)

   Daytona builds the Project image using an image you specify.

- [**None**](#none)

   Daytona creates the Project using the default base image.

## Automatic

Daytona can auto-detect the most appropriate Builder for your Project. Daytona uses the following logic to determine which Builder to use:

1. Check if a Dev Container configuration is present in **`.devcontainer.json`** or **`.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`**, relative to the repository root.
2. If present, use the [Dev Container](#dev-container) Builder. If not present, use the [None](#none) Builder.

To use the Automatic Builder, set the `--builder` flag value to `auto` during the [Workspace creation](/docs/en/usage/workspaces#create-a-workspace). This flag only applies when creating Workspaces with a single Project.

```shell
daytona create <REPO_URL> --builder=auto
```

## Dev Container

Development Containers (Dev Containers) provide a consistent and fully featured development environments for your [Projects](/docs/en/usage/projects). A Dev Container defines all the necessary tools, runtime, and environment configurations required to build and run your Projects.

The Dev Container specification is designed to define a development environment that can be replicated across different platforms and CI/CD systems. The specification is defined within a `devcontainer.json` file in the project repository.

The `devcontainer.json` file is a JSON file that consists of components that define the development environment. The file includes objects with properties containing metadata and settings required to configurate a development container. View the [dev container specification](https://containers.dev/implementors/json_reference/) for more information.

Use [devcontainer.ai](https://devcontainer.ai/) to generate a `devcontainer.json` file for your Project.

Example `devcontainer.json` file:

```sh
{
    "name": "Example Python & PostgreSQL Dev Container",
    "build": {
        "dockerfile": "Dockerfile",
        "args": {
            "VARIANT": "3.8",
            "INSTALL_NODE": "false"
        }
    },
    "settings": {
        "terminal.integrated.shell.linux": "/bin/bash"
    },
    "extensions": [
        "ms-python.python",
        "ms-azuretools.vscode-docker"
    ],
    "postCreateCommand": "pip install -r requirements.txt",
    "remoteUser": "vscode"
}
```

- `name`: The name of the development container.
- `build`: The build configuration for the development container.
- `settings`: The settings for the development container.
- `extensions`: The extensions to install in the development container.
- `postCreateCommand`: The command to run after creating the development container.
- `remoteUser`: The user to execute commands as during the image build process.

Daytona provides the option to build the Project image using the Dev Container standard. Use the following option available when using the Dev Container Builder:

- **Devcontainer file path**

   The path where the Dev Container configuration is located, relative to the repository root.
   The default value is `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`.

To use the Dev Container Builder, set the `--devcontainer-path` flag to the Dev Container configuration path within the repository during the [Workspace creation](/docs/en/usage/workspaces#create-a-workspace). This flag only applies when creating Workspaces with a single Project.

```shell showLineNumbers
daytona create <REPO_URL> --devcontainer-path=.devcontainer/devcontainer.json
```

:::note
For more information on the Dev Container standard, refer to the official documentation at [containers.dev](https://containers.dev/).

## Custom Image

You can build the Project image by specifying a custom base container.
The following options are accepted when using this Builder:

- **Custom container image**

   The name of the base container image for the Project.

- **Container user**

   The user to execute commands as during the image build process.

- **Environment variables**

   A list of environment variables in the format `KEY=VALUE`.

To use the Custom Image Builder, set both `--custom-image` and `--custom-image-user` flags while [creating a Workspace](/docs/en/usage/workspaces#create-a-workspace). These flags only apply when creating Workspaces with a single Project.

```shell
daytona create <REPO_URL> --custom-image=daytona-workspace:latest --custom-image-user=daytona
```

## None

Daytona can build a Project using the default base image.

Unless otherwise configured using `daytona server configure`, the default base image is set to `daytonaio/workspace-project`.

## Custom Build Registry

You can set a custom build registry for images built by a Daytona Builder.
After an image is built, it will be uploaded to the configured container registry to speed up future Workspace creation for the same Project.

**Prerequisite**

- An account on an accessible container registry with permission to push/pull images.

1. Execute the following command to configure the custom build registry:

```shell
daytona container-registry set
```

2. Set the required options:

- **Server URL**

   The full URL to your custom container registry.

- **Username**

   The username Daytona should use to log in to the container registry.

- **Password**

   The password for your container registry account.

3. Press <Keyboard shortcuts="Enter" /> to set the custom build registry.
4. Execute the following command to configure the server:

```shell
daytona server configure
```

5. Press <Keyboard shortcuts="Enter" /> until the "Builder Registry" section is highlighted.

```text
Builder Registry
To add options, add a container registry with 'daytona cr set'
> Local registry managed by Daytona
```

6. Select the custom registry configured previously using <Keyboard shortcuts="↑" /> / <Keyboard shortcuts="↓" /> arrow keys.
7. Press <Keyboard shortcuts="Enter" /> until the command exits to save the configuration.

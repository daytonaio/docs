Run the following commands to purge local Daytona data:

```shell
rmdir /s /q "%LOCALAPPDATA%\daytona"
```

Run the following command to remove the Daytona binary:

```shell
where daytona > nul && del /f /q "$(where daytona)"
```

Run the following command to remove the Daytona SSH configuration file:

```shell
del /f /q "%USERPROFILE%\.ssh\daytona_config"
```

Edit your `%USERPROFILE%\.ssh\config` file to remove the `Include daytona_config entry`. You can do this manually by opening the file in a text editor (e.g., Notepad):

```shell
notepad "%USERPROFILE%\.ssh\config"
```

Run the following command to remove the Daytona registry container:

```shell
docker rm /daytona-registry
```

If you have generated any autocomplete scripts for Daytona, you will need to remove them manually from your shell configuration files (e.g., `%USERPROFILE%\.bashrc`, `%USERPROFILE%\.zshrc`).

To ensure all traces of Daytona are removed from your system, check and delete any related files or directories in `C:\Program Files\`, `C:\Program Files (x86)\`, and `C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\Temp\` directories.

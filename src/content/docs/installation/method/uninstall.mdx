Run the following commands to purge local Daytona data and remove the binary:

```shell
daytona purge
```

Run the following commands if the `daytona purge` command does not work, or if you want to manually purge local Daytona data and remove the binary:

```shell
rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/daytona
sudo rm $(whereis daytona | awk '{print $2}')
```

Additionally, to fully remove all Daytona-related configurations and components, run the following command:

```shell
rm -f ~/.ssh/daytona_config
```

Edit your `~/.ssh/config` file to remove the `Include daytona_config entry`. You can do this manually by running the following command:

```shell
nano ~/.ssh/config
```

Remove the local Daytona registry container by running the following command:

```shell
docker rm /daytona-registry
```

If you have generated any autocomplete scripts for Daytona, you will need to remove them manually from your shell configuration files (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`).

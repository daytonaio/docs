You can uninstall Daytona by following this procedure.

<Aside type="caution">
This procedure is destructive and irreversible.
Ensure you have a backup of any Workspace data and relevant configuration before proceeding.
</Aside>

<br />

1. Run the following commands to purge local Daytona data and remove the binary:

    ```shell
    daytona purge
    ```

    Run the following commands if the `daytona purge` command does not work, or if you want to manually purge local Daytona data and remove the binary:

    ```shell
    rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/daytona
    sudo rm $(whereis daytona | awk '{print $2}')
    ```

    Additionally, to fully remove all Daytona-related configurations and components, run the following command:

    ```shell
    rm -f ~/.ssh/daytona_config
    ```

    Edit your `~/.ssh/config` file to remove the `Include daytona_config entry`. You can do this manually by running the following command:

    ```shell
    nano ~/.ssh/config
    ```

    Remove the local Daytona registry container by running the following command:

    ```shell
    docker rm /daytona-registry
    ```

    If you have generated any autocomplete scripts for Daytona, you will need to remove them manually from your shell configuration files (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`).

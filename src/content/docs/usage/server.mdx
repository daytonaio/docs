The Daytona Server is a daemon that runs on your machine and handles actions relating to Workspaces.
The primary method of interacting with the server is through the Daytona CLI, although it's possible to interact manually using a HTTP interface.

## Configuring the Server

The server configuration is located in different directories depending on your operating system.
The server configuration can be viewed by using the following command across all operating systems:

```shell
  daytona server config
```

Daytona server configuration contains the following properties:

- **Server ID**

    Example: `12a34bc5-d67e-890f-1gh2-34i5jk6l7m89`

- **API URL**
  
    The URL endpoint for the Daytona API.

    Example: `https://api-12a34bc5-d67e-890f-1gh2-34i5jk6l7m89.try-eu.daytona.app`

- **API Port**
  
    The port number on which the Daytona API is accessible.

    Example: `3986`

- **Default Project Image**
  
    The default Docker image used for projects.

    Example: `daytonaio/workspace-project:latest`

- **Default Project User**

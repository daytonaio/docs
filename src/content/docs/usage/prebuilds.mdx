Prebuilds are designed to accelerate development by pre-building your Workspace. When you start a Workspace, the prebuilt environment is used, ensuring that the Workspace is initiated almost instantly.

Prebuilds achieve this by setting up a [project configuration](/usage/projects#project-configuration) that monitors changes in the connected Git Provider's repository.

Prebuilds work by registering a listener for webhook events from the Git Provider. A public API endpoint is provided, which the Git Provider uses to send these requests.

## Add a Prebuild

1. Run the following command to add a new Prebuild:

   ```shell
   daytona prebuilds add
   ```

   Using the command opens a view that prompts you to select a project configuration and the Git branch you plan to work on. You can then decide on a commit interval after which a build should be triggered, as well as any specific trigger files whose changes should immediately start the build process.

   ```text
   Commit interval
   >
   ```

   ```text
   Trigger Files
   Enter full paths for files whose changes you want to explicitly trigger a prebuild. Use new lines for multiple entries.
   ```

Subsequent `daytona create` calls will automatically detect the most recent existing build and use it to create the project.

## List Prebuilds

Daytona allows you to list all Prebuilds, providing you with an overview of the properties stored within each Prebuild configuration.

1. Run the following command to list all Prebuilds:

   ```shell
   daytona build list
   ```

   Upon running this command, Daytona will display a list of your Prebuilds. You will be able to view the ID, the Configuration Hash it is linked to, the current state, the Prebuild ID, and the creation timestamp.

      ```text
      ID                Configuration Hash   State    Prebuild ID   Created
      ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
      abcdefghij12345   abcd1234efgh56789    pending  abcd12        3 minutes ago
   ```

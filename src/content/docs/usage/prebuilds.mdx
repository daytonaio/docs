Prebuilds are designed to accelerate development by pre-building your Workspace. When you start a Workspace, the prebuilt environment is used, ensuring that the Workspace is initiated almost instantly.

Prebuilds achieve this by setting up a [project configuration](/usage/projects#project-configuration) that monitors changes in the connected Git Provider's repository.

Prebuilds work by registering a listener for webhook events from the Git Provider. A public API endpoint is provided, which the Git Provider uses to send these requests.

## Add a Prebuild

1. Run the following command to add a new Prebuild:

   ```shell
   daytona prebuilds add
   ```

   <Aside type="note">
      Add a `--run` flag to the command to automatically run the build after creating the Prebuild.
   </Aside>

   <br />

   Upon running the command, Daytona will prompt you to select a project configuration you plan to work on. You can then decide on a commit interval (e.g. `5`, _every 5 commits_) after which a build should be triggered, any specific trigger files whose changes should immediately start the build process, and build retention (the maximum number of builds to store at a time).

   ```text
   Select a Project Config To Prebuild
   1 item
   MyConfig
   https://github.com/username/myproject.git
   ```

   ```text
   Commit interval
   Leave blank to ignore push events
   >
   ```

   ```text
   Trigger Files
   Enter full paths for files whose changes you want to explicitly trigger a prebuild. Use new lines for multiple entries.
   ```

   ```text
   Retention
   Maximum number of resulting builds stored at a time
   >
   ```

Subsequent `daytona create` calls will automatically detect the most recent existing build and use it to create the project.

## Use a Prebuild

Once you added a Prebuild, it becomes active immediately based on the [project configuration](usage/projects#project-configuration) you provided. The Prebuild will automatically run whenever the specified conditions are met, such as when the defined number of commits is reached. For instance, if you specified a commit interval of `5`, the Prebuild will run after every `5` commits to the repository.

As soon as you add a Prebuild, a build process will automatically start in the background unless you have configured it otherwise. The initial build process may take some time to complete, but subsequent builds will be significantly faster. However, if you try to create a Workspace before this build is completed, Daytona will start a fresh build, which might take longer.

It is recommended to wait (e.g., 10 minutes) for the initial build to complete before creating a Workspace.

You can now create a Workspace using the Prebuild by running the following command:

```shell
daytona create
```

Upon running this command, Daytona will detect the most recent Prebuild associated with the selected project configuration. The Workspace will then use this Prebuild, significantly speeding up the setup process.

During the Workspace creation process, if the initial Prebuild has finished, the setup will be almost instantaneous, utilizing the cached environment. Otherwise, a new build will be triggered, potentially slowing down the Workspace creation.

## List Prebuilds

Daytona allows you to list all Prebuilds, providing you with an overview of the properties stored within each Prebuild configuration.

1. Run the following command to list all Prebuilds:

   ```shell
   daytona prebuilds list
   ```

   Upon running this command, Daytona will display a list of your Prebuilds. You will be able to view the project configuration, the branch it is linked to, the commit interval, the trigger files, and the build retention.

      ```text
      Project Config   Branch  Commit Interval  Trigger files  Build Retention
      ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
      MyConfig         main    5                None           3
   ```

## Prebuilds Information

Daytona allows you to view detailed information of a Prebuild, providing you with an overview of the properties stored within it.

1. Run the following command to view the details of a Prebuild:

   ```shell
   daytona prebuilds info
   ```

2. Select the Prebuild you want to view.

   ```text
   Select a Prebuild To View
   1 item
   MyConfig (main)                                                              
   abcd1234efg (every 5 commits)
   ```

   Upon selecting the Prebuild, Daytona will display the details of the selected Prebuild. You will be able to view the Prebuild ID, the project configuration, the branch it is linked to, the commit interval, the trigger files, and the build retention.

   ```text
   Prebuild Configuration Info                                                                   
                                                                                                  
   ID                   abcd1234efg
   Project config       MyConfig
   Branch               main
   Commit interval      5
   Build retention      3
   ```

## Update Prebuilds

Daytona allows you to update a Prebuild, helping you manage and modify the Prebuild configuration.

1. Run the following command to update a Prebuild:

   ```shell
   daytona prebuilds update
   ```

2. Select the Prebuild you want to update.

   ```text
   Select a Prebuild To Update
   1 item
   MyConfig (main)                                                              
   abcd1234efg (every 5 commits)
   ```

   Upon selecting the Prebuild, Daytona will prompt you to update the Prebuild commit interval, trigger files, and build retention.

   ```text
   Commit interval
   >
   ```

   ```text
   Trigger Files
   Enter full paths for files whose changes you want to explicitly trigger a prebuild. Use new lines for multiple entries.
   ```

   ```text
   Retention
   Maximum number of resulting builds stored at a time
   >
   ```

   Upon updating the Prebuild configuration, Daytona will display a success message.

   ```text
   Prebuild updated successfully
   ```

## Delete Prebuilds

Daytona allows you to delete Prebuilds, helping you manage and remove those that are no longer needed.

1. Run the following command to delete a Prebuild:

   ```shell
   daytona prebuilds delete
   ```

2. Select the Prebuild you want to delete.

   ```text
   Select a Prebuild To Delete
   1 item
   MyConfig (main)
   abcd1234efg (every 5 commits)
   ```

   ```text
   Prebuild deleted successfully
   ```

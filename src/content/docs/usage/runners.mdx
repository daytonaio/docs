A Runner is a standalone service that can be deployed anywhere. The user can deploy a Runner on a target system by executing a set of instructions and commands generated upon Runner registration.

Once deployed, the Runner starts up and connects to the [Daytona Server](/docs/usage/server), at which point its status is marked as `Running`.

The Runner sends all requests, while the Server only responds. The Runner sends requests such as _Heartbeat_ (to share its status) and _Job Requests_ (to ask Daytona Server for tasks assigned to it).

A single Runner can use multiple [Providers](/docs/configuration/providers), configured during deployment or later via jobs, enabling flexibility for various environments.

## Register a Runner

Daytona provides an option to register a new Runner, allowing you to deploy it on a target system and connect it to the Daytona Server.

1. Run the following command to register a new Runner:

```shell
daytona runner register
```

Upon running the command, Daytona will generate a code snippet containing the server API URL and API key required to deploy the Runner on the target system.

2. Paste the code snippet into the target system's terminal and execute it to deploy the Runner.

## Start a Runner

Once the Runner is deployed on the target system, you can start it by running the following command:

```shell
daytona runner start
```

The Runner will connect to the Daytona Server and its status will be marked as `Running`.

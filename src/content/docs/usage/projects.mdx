Projects represent a comprehensive set of settings and resources that define how your code is managed, built, and deployed within a Workspace. Each Project is associated with a specific repository and contains the necessary configurations to ensure a consistent development environment.

## Project Configuration

A project configuration is designed to simplify the management of development environments, allowing you to predefine settings that can be easily applied to any new or existing Workspace.

A project configuration contains all necessary properties to define and manage projects within a Workspace. It stores information such as the repository URL, build configuration, and environment variables. This allows for easy reuse of previously set configurations, ensuring a consistent and reproducible setup across multiple Workspaces.

A project configuration encapsulates all the essential elements for setting up a project, including:

- **Repository URL**

   The URL of the Git repository associated with the Project.

- **Build Configuration**

  - [Automatic](/usage/builders#automatic-builder) auto-detects the most appropriate Builder for your project.
  - [Devcontainer](/usage/builders#dev-container-builder) utilizes a predefined development container specified by a `devcontainer.json` file.
  - [Custom image](/usage/builders#custom-image-builder) builds the Project image by specifying a custom base container.
  - [None](/usage/builders#none) builds a Project by using the default base image (`daytonaio/workspace-project`).

- **Environment Variables**

   Environment variables are specified in the `KEY=VALUE` format. These variables are essential for the Project's build and runtime environments. You can set the variables directly or pass them from the machine's environment during execution.

- **Project Configuration name**

   A unique identifier for the Project Configuration, which distinguishes it from other configurations within the system.

With the `daytona project-config` command, you can add, view, update, list, set as default, or delete Project Configurations, giving you full control over the configuration and reuse of your Project setups across different Workspaces.

## Add a Project Configuration

Daytona allows you to add a new Project Configuration, enabling you to store and reuse project properties across multiple Workspaces.

1. Run the following command to add a new Project Configuration:

   ```shell
   daytona project-config add
   ```

2. Enter the repository URL of the project you want to configure.

   ```text
      Git repository
      >
   ```

3. Select the build configuration for the project.

   ```text
      Choose a build configuration
      Automatic
      Devcontainer
      Custom image
      None
   ```

4. Enter the environment variables for the project in the `KEY=VALUE` format.

   ```text
      Environment Variables
      Enter environment variables in the format KEY=VALUE
      To pass machine env variables at runtime, use $VALUE
   ```

5. Enter a name for the Project Configuration.

   ```text
      Project config name
      >
   ```

   Upon completion, Daytona will save the Project Configuration, allowing you to reuse it across multiple Workspaces.

## Project Configuration Information

Daytona allows you to view detailed information of a Project Configuration, providing you with an overview of the properties stored within it.

1. Run the following command to view the details of a Project Configuration:

   ```shell
   daytona project-config info
   ```

   Upon running this command, Daytona will display a list of your Project Configurations

2. Select the Project Configuration you want to view.

   ```text
      Select a Project Config To View
      1 item

      ┃  MyProjectConfig
      ┃  https://github.com/username/MyProject
   ```

   Upon selecting the Project Configuration, Daytona will display the details of the selected configuration. You will be able to view the Project Configuration name, the repository URL it is linked to, the build configuration, and the Devcontainer path.

   ```text
      Project Config Info

      Name                    MyProjectConfig
      Repository              https://github.com/username/MyProject
      Build                   Devcontainer
      Devcontainer path       .devcontainer/devcontainer.json
   ```

## List Project Configuration

Daytona allows you to list all Project Configurations, providing you with an overview of the properties stored within each configuration.

1. Run the following command to list all Project Configurations:

   ```shell
   daytona project-config list
   ```

   Upon running this command, Daytona will display a list of your Project Configurations. You will be able to view the Project Configuration name, the repository URL it is connected to, the build configuration, and if it is set as a default configuration.

   ```text
      Name                Repository             Build             Default
      ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
      MyProjectConfig     daytonaio/daytona      Devcontainer      Yes
   ```

## Set Default Project Configuration

Daytona allows you to set a default Project Configuration, enabling you to define a configuration that will be used by default when creating new Workspaces.

1. Run the following command to set a default Project Configuration:

   ```shell
   daytona project-config set-default
   ```

2. Select the Project Configuration you want to set as the default.

   ```text
      Select a Project Config To Set As Default
      1 item

      ┃  MyProjectConfig
      ┃  https://github.com/username/MyProject
   ```

   Upon selecting the default Project Configuration, Daytona will set it as the default configuration for new Workspaces.

   ```text
      Project config 'MyProjectConfig' set as default
   ```

## Update Project Configuration

Daytona allows you to update an existing Project Configuration, enabling you to modify the properties stored within it.

1. Run the following command to update a Project Configuration:

   ```shell
   daytona project-config update
   ```

2. Select the Project Configuration you want to update.

   ```text
      Select a Project Config To Update
      1 item

      ┃  MyProjectConfig
      ┃  https://github.com/username/MyProject
   ```

3. Update the properties of the Project Configuration.

   ```text
      Choose a build configuration
      Automatic
      Devcontainer
      Custom image
      None
   ```

   ```text
      Environment Variables
      Enter environment variables in the format KEY=VALUE
      To pass machine env variables at runtime, use $VALUE
   ```

   Upon completion, Daytona will save the updated Project Configuration, allowing you to reuse it across Workspaces.

   ```text
      Project config updated successfully
   ```

## Delete Project Configuration

Daytona allows you to delete an existing Project Configuration, enabling you to remove properties that are no longer needed.

1. Run the following command to delete a Project Configuration:

   ```shell
   daytona project-config delete
   ```

2. Select the Project Configuration you want to delete.

   ```text
      Select a Project Config To Delete
      1 item

      ┃  MyProjectConfig
      ┃  https://github.com/username/MyProject
   ```

   ```text
      Project config deleted successfully
   ```

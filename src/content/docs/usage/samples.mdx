Samples are quick-start repositories with predefined development configurations, environments, and dependencies used to create Workspaces.

## Custom Samples

Daytona provides an option to use custom Samples to create Workspaces. Creating custom Samples is a two-step process that involves:

- [**Sample Repository**](#sample-repository)

    A repository containing the Sample code and a `devcontainer.json` file defining the development environment.

- [**Samples Index**](#samples-index)

    Samples Index (`index.json`) file serving as a registry of available Samples for creating Workspaces.

### Sample Repository

Custom Sample repository is a Git repository that contains the Sample code and a `devcontainer.json` file that defines the development environment. The repository serves as the core content of the Sample and is used to create a Workspace.

1. Create a repository representing the custom Sample.

2. Define the custom Sample code, development configurations and dependencies.

3. Create a **`devcontainer.json`** file that defines the development environment.

- Use the [development container standard](https://containers.dev/) to define your development environment. Development containers vary based on the programming language, configurations, and tools used within the Sample.

Example of a **`devcontainer.json`** file for development environment using Go programming language:

```json
{
    "name": "Go",
    "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/go:1-1.21-bookworm",
    "customizations": {
        "vscode": {
            "extensions": [
                "golang.Go"
            ]
        }
    },
    "postCreateCommand": "go test -v"
}
```

4. Host the Sample repository on a Git repository or another platform.

5. Add Sample properties to the [Samples Index](#samples-index).

Sample will be used to create a Workspace by cloning the repository and using the `devcontainer.json` file to define the development environment.

### Samples Index

Samples require a Sample Index (`index.json`) file that serves as a registry of available Samples for creating Workspaces. The Samples Index is used to display the available Samples when creating a Workspace.

1. Create an **`index.json`** file representing the Samples Index.

2. Define an array of JSON objects representing the Samples.

    Each JSON object in the array represents a Sample:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "My Custom Sample",
    "description": "My custom Samples description",
    "gitUrl": "https://github.com/<username>/<repository>"
  }
]
```

- **`name`**

    Name of the Sample.

- **`gitUrl`**

    Link to the publicly available Sample repository.

3. Host the **`index.json`** file publicly on a Git repository or another platform.

4. Run the following command to configure the Samples Index URL:

```sh
daytona server configure
```

5. Enter the public raw URL of the **`index.json`** file in the **`Samples Index URL`** field.

```text
Samples Index URL
Leave empty to disable samples
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<username>/<repository>/<path>/index.json
```

```text
Server configuration updated. You need to restart the server for the changes to take effect.
```

6. Restart the Daytona server to apply the changes.

```sh
daytona server restart
```

Custom Samples will be available available when creating a Workspace. The chosen Sample will be cloned and used to create the Workspace.

## Daytona Samples

Daytona provides a collection of default Samples with predefined development configurations, environments, and dependencies. Daytona Samples are available to choose from when [creating a Workspace](/usage/workspaces#create-a-workspace).

Daytona Samples are integrated via a Samples Index (`index.json`) file that serves as a registry of available Daytona Samples for creating Workspaces.

The chosen Sample will be cloned and used to create the Workspace. The Daytona Sample repository will serve as the core content of the Sample used to create a Workspace.

View the list of available Daytona Samples in the [Samples Index](https://github.com/daytonaio/daytona/blob/main/hack/samples/index.json).

:::tip
You can contribute to the Daytona Samples by suggesting new Samples to be added to the [Daytona Samples Index](https://github.com/daytonaio/daytona/blob/main/hack/samples/index.json).

Workspaces serve as isolated environments containing your project’s codebase, dependencies, packages, and configuration, providing a consistent and reproducible setup for development, testing, and deployment.

They ensure that changes in one project do not inadvertently affect another, promoting a more stable and reliable workflow. This is particularly beneficial in collaborative settings, as it ensures that all team members are working with the same configuration, reducing the likelihood of environment-related issues.

## Create a Workspace

Creating your own Workspace in Daytona is a straightforward process that ensures you have a dedicated environment for your projects.

**Prerequisite**

- **At least [one Target configured](../configuration/providers#managing-targets)**.

  Targets are essential for deploying your Workspaces, so make sure you have configured at least one.

### From a Git Repository

Creating a Workspace allows you to set up a new environment either by selecting a repository from a configured Git provider like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or Gitea, or by manually entering a Git repository URL.

1. Run the following command to start the guided Workspace creation process:

   ```shell
   daytona create
   ```

   <Aside type="tip">
      You can open a new Workspace in an [IDE](/usage/ide) by using the `--code` flag.

      ```shell
      daytona create --code
      ```

   </Aside>

   <br />

2. Select the Git Provider you want to use or select to enter a custom repository URL. Daytona provides two options for linking your repository:

   - **Selecting from a List of Repositories**

     If you choose a Git provider (e.g., GitHub), you will be presented with a list of your repositories from which you can select the desired repository.

   - **Entering a Custom Repository URL**

     Alternatively, you can select the option to enter a custom repository URL manually if the repository is not listed under your Git provider account or is from an external source.

   ```text
      Choose a Provider
      2 items
      ===
      GitHub
      Enter a custom repository URL
   ```

3. Select the repository from the list or enter the URL of the Git repository you want to link with your Workspace.

4. Enter a name for your Workspace.

   <br />

   <Aside type="note">
     You can press `F10` to configure advanced settings for your Workspace,
     including setting the [Builder](/usage/builders).
   </Aside>

   <br />

5. Wait while Daytona sets up your Workspace. It handles all the initialization and configuration of your environment.

   ```text
      WORKSPACE | ✓ Request submitted
      WORKSPACE | ✓ Creating workspace daytona
      daytona   | Creating project daytona
      daytona   | Pulling image...
      daytona   | Pulling from daytonaio/workspace-project
      ...
      daytona   | Project daytona created
      daytona   | Starting project daytona
      daytona   | Project daytona started
   ```

### From an Arbitrary Git URL

Creating a Workspace from an arbitrary Git URL allows you to set up a new environment by directly specifying the URL of the remote repository. This method is useful for setting up environments that are not linked to a pre-configured Git Provider in Daytona.

1. Run the following command to create a Workspace from a remote Git repository:

   ```shell
   daytona create <REPO_URL>
   ```

   **Example**

   ```shell
   daytona create https://github.com/daytonaio/daytona.git
   ```

   Upon running this command, Daytona will clone the specified Git repository and set up a new Workspace based on its contents. You will see progress information in the terminal, indicating the process of the Workspace creation. Once complete, the Workspace will be ready for use with the specified repository.

   ```text
      WORKSPACE | ✓ Request submitted
      WORKSPACE | ✓ Creating workspace daytona
      daytona   | Creating project daytona
      daytona   | Pulling image...
      daytona   | Pulling from daytonaio/workspace-project
      ...
      daytona   | Project daytona created
      daytona   | Starting project daytona
      daytona   | Project daytona started
   ```

   <Aside type="tip">
   You can set the Project Builder at Workspace creation time using command-line
   flags. Refer to **[Builders](/usage/builders)** for more information.
   </Aside>

## Forward Ports from a Workspace

Daytona supports flexible port forwarding, allowing you to access services running in a Workspace locally or via a shareable public URL.
With port forwarding, you can work on your project in a Workspace and test your code externally.

### Access a Port Locally

You can access services running in a Workspace on your local machine.

**Prerequisite**

- A running Workspace with at least one service accessible via TCP/UDP.

1. Run the following command to forward a port from a running Workspace to your local machine:

   ```shell
   daytona forward <PORT> <WORKSPACE> <PROJECT>
   ```

   **Example:** Allow local access to port 4321 of the `example-dev-env` Workspace.

   ```shell
   daytona forward 4321 example-dev-env
   ```

   Upon running this command, Daytona will establish a port forwarding connection from the specified port in the Workspace to your local machine. The terminal will display a message indicating the local port where the forwarded connection is available:

   `Port available at http://localhost:4321`

### Access a Port via Public URL

You can access services running in a Workspace via a generated public URL.
This allows you to share your work with others in real-time.

:::note

:::

**Prerequisite**

- A running Workspace with at least one service accessible via TCP/UDP.

1. Run the following command to generate a public URL for a port on a running Workspace:

   ```shell
   daytona forward <PORT> <WORKSPACE> <PROJECT> --public
   ```

   **Example:** Generate a URL to access port 4321 of the `example-dev-env` Workspace.

   ```shell
   daytona forward 4321 example-dev-env --public
   ```

   Upon running this command, Daytona will first establish a local port forwarding connection and display a message indicating the local port where the forwarded connection is available.

   ```text
      Port available at http://localhost:4321
   ```

   Then, Daytona will proceed to forward the port to a public URL. The terminal will display progress information and, upon completion, provide the generated public URL.

   ```text
      Forwarding port to a public URL...
      Port available at:
      https://4321-ABC1DeF2GhI3JkLmNoP4RSTuVZ5.try-eu.daytona.app
   ```

   This URL can be shared with others to provide real-time access to the service running on the specified port in your Workspace.

<Aside type="tip">
Alternatively, you can generate a public URL by executing the following command in a Workspace's shell:

```shell
daytona forward <PORT> --public
```

## Project Configuration

Project Configuration contains all necessary properties to define and manage projects within a Workspace. It stores information such as the repository URL, build configuration, and environment variables. This allows for easy reuse of previously set configurations, ensuring a consistent and reproducible setup across multiple projects.

A Project Configuration encapsulates all the essential elements for setting up a project, including:

- **Repository URL**

   The URL of the Git repository associated with the project.

- **Build Configuration**

  - [Automatic](/usage/builders#automatic-builder)
  - [Devcontainer](/usage/builders#dev-container-builder)
  - [Custom image](/usage/builders#custom-image-builder)
  - [None](/usage/builders#none)

- **Environment Variables**

   Environment variables specified in the `KEY=VALUE` format.

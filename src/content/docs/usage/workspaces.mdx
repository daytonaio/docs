Workspaces serve as isolated environments containing your project’s codebase, dependencies, packages, and configuration, providing a consistent and reproducible setup for development, testing, and deployment.

They ensure that changes in one project do not inadvertently affect another, promoting a more stable and reliable workflow. This is particularly beneficial in collaborative settings, as it ensures that all team members are working with the same configuration, reducing the likelihood of environment-related issues.

## Create a Workspace

Creating your own Workspace in Daytona is a straightforward process that ensures you have a dedicated environment for your projects. Follow the steps to set up your Workspace efficiently.

**Prerequisites**

- **A working installation of Daytona**.

  Verify your Daytona installation is up-to-date to avoid compatibility issues.

- **At least one Target configured**.

  Targets are essential for deploying your Workspaces, so make sure you have configured at least one.

### From a Configured Git Provider

Creating a Workspace from a configured Git Provider allows you to link your development environment directly to a repository hosted on platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or Gitea.

This method ensures that your Workspace is set up with the latest codebase and configuration from the specified repository.

**Procedure**

1. Execute the following command to start the guided Workspace creation process:

   ```shell
   daytona create
   ```

2. Select the Git Provider and the repository you want your Workspace to be configured with. This selection links your Workspace directly to your version control system.

   ```text
      Choose a Provider
      2 items
      ===
      GitHub
      Enter a custom repository URL
   ```

3. Enter a name for your Workspace. Provide a descriptive name for your Workspace that reflects its purpose or project.
   <Aside type="note">
     You can press `F10` to configure advanced settings for your Workspace,
     including setting the [Builder](../usage/builders).
   </Aside>
4. Wait while Daytona sets up your Workspace. It handles all the initialization and configuration of your environment.

<Aside type="tip">
You can open a new Workspace in Visual Studio Code after creation by using the `--code` flag.

```shell
daytona create --code
```

</Aside>

### From an Arbitrary Git URL

Creating a Workspace from a remote Git repository involves specifying the URL of the repository. This method is useful for setting up environments that are not linked to a pre-configured Git Provider in Daytona.

**Procedure**

1. Execute the following command to create a Workspace from a remote Git repository:

   ```shell
   daytona create <REPO_URL>
   ```

   **Example**

   ```shell
   daytona create https://github.com/daytonaio/daytona.git
   ```

   Upon running this command, Daytona will clone the specified Git repository and set up a new Workspace based on its contents. You will see progress information in the terminal, indicating the process of the Workspace creation. Once complete, the Workspace will be ready for use with the specified repository.

   ```text
      WORKSPACE | ✓ Request submitted
      WORKSPACE | ✓ Creating workspace daytona
      daytona   | Creating project daytona
      daytona   | Pulling image...
      daytona   | Pulling from daytonaio/workspace-project
      ...
      daytona   | Project daytona created
      daytona   | Starting project daytona
      daytona   | Project daytona started
   ```

2. Wait while Daytona sets up your Workspace. It handles all the initialization and configuration of your environment.

<Aside type="tip">
You can set the Project Builder at Workspace creation time using command-line flags.
These flags only apply when creating Workspaces with a single Project.
- To use the Custom Image Builder, set both `--custom-image` and `--custom-image-user` flags.
- To use the Dev Container Builder, set the`--devcontainer-path` flag to the Dev Container configuration path within the repository.
- To explicitly specify the Builder, set the`--builder` flag.
    Accepted values are `auto`, `devcontainer`, or `none`.

**Example**

```shell
daytona create <REPO_URL> --custom-image=daytona-workspace:latest --custom-image-user=daytona
daytona create <REPO_URL> --devcontainer-path=.devcontainer/devcontainer.json
daytona create <REPO_URL> --builder=auto
```

</Aside>

## List Workspaces

Daytona allows you to keep track of your development environments by listing all previously created Workspaces. This helps you manage multiple projects and ensure that you can easily access and maintain your Workspaces.

1. Execute the following command to see a list of Workspaces:

   ```shell

### Forward Ports from a Workspace

Daytona supports flexible port forwarding, allowing you to access services running in a Workspace locally or via a shareable public URL.
With port forwarding, you can work on your project in a Workspace and test your code externally.

#### Access a Port Locally

You can access services running in a Workspace on your local machine.

**Prerequisites**

- **A working installation of Daytona**

  Verify your Daytona installation is up-to-date to avoid compatibility issues.

- **A running Workspace with at least one service accessible via TCP/UDP.**

**Procedure**

1. Execute the following command to forward a port from a running Workspace to your local machine:

   ```shell
   daytona forward <PORT> <WORKSPACE> <PROJECT>
   ```

   **Example:** Allow local access to port 4321 of the `example-dev-env` Workspace.

   ```shell
   daytona forward 4321 example-dev-env
   ```

   Upon running this command, Daytona will establish a port forwarding connection from the specified port in the Workspace to your local machine or via a shareable public URL. The terminal will display a message indicating the local port where the forwarded connection is available:

   `Port available at http://localhost:4321`

#### Access a Port via Public URL

You can access services running in a Workspace via a generated public URL.
This allows you to share your work with others in real-time.

:::note
This feature uses a free public proxy service hosted by Daytona Platforms, Inc.
By using this feature, you acknowledge that your data is processed in accordance with Daytona's [Privacy Policy](https://www.daytona.io/company/privacy-policy) and [Terms of Service](https://www.daytona.io/company/terms-of-service).
:::

**Prerequisites**

- **A working installation of Daytona.**

  Verify your Daytona installation is up-to-date to avoid compatibility issues.

- A running Workspace with at least one service accessible via TCP/UDP.

**Procedure**

1. Execute the following command to generate a public URL for a port on a running Workspace:

   ```shell
   daytona forward <PORT> <WORKSPACE> <PROJECT> --public
   ```

   **Example:** Generate a URL to access port 4321 of the `example-dev-env` Workspace.

   ```shell
   daytona forward 4321 example-dev-env --public
   ```

   Upon running this command, Daytona will first establish a local port forwarding connection and display a message indicating the local port where the forwarded connection is available.

   ```text
      Port available at http://localhost:4321
   ```

   Then, Daytona will proceed to forward the port to a public URL. The terminal will display progress information and, upon completion, provide the generated public URL.

   ```text
      Forwarding port to a public URL...
      Port available at:
      https://4321-ABC1DeF2GhI3JkLmNoP4RSTuVZ5.try-eu.daytona.app
   ```

   This URL can be shared with others to provide real-time access to the service running on the specified port in your Workspace.

<Aside type="tip">
Alternatively, you can generate a public URL by executing the following command in a Workspace's shell:

```shell
daytona forward <PORT> --public
```

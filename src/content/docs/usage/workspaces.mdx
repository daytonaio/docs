Workspaces contain your project's codebase, dependencies and packages, and configuration.
Daytona allows you to create Workspaces on various Git Providers

## Create a Workspace
You can create a Workspace.

__Prerequisites__
*   A working installation of Daytona.
*   At least 1 Target configured.

### From a Configured Git Provider
__Procedure__
1.  Execute the following command to start the guided Workspace creation process:
    ```shell
    daytona create
    ```
2.  Select the Git Provider and repository you want your Workspace to be configured with.
3.  Wait for Daytona to create the Workspace.

<Aside type="tip">
To automatically open a new Workspace in Visual Studio Code after creation, use the `--code` flag.

__Example:__
```shell
daytona create --code
```
</Aside>

### From an Arbitrary Git URL
__Procedure__
1.  Execute the following command to create a Workspace from a remote Git repository:
    ```shell
    daytona create <REPO_URL>
    ```

    __Example__
    ```shell
    daytona create https://github.com/daytonaio/daytona.git
    ```
2.  Wait for Daytona to create the Workspace.

## List Workspaces
You can list all previously created Workspaces.

1.  Execute the following command to see a list of Workspaces:
    ```shell
    daytona list
    ```

## Open An Existing Workspace
You can open an existing Workspace in your IDE.

__Prerequisites__
*   A working installation of Daytona.
*   At least 1 existing Workspace.

__Procedure__
1.  Execute the following command to list existing Workspaces:
    ```shell
    daytona code
    ```
2.  Select the Workspace you want to open.

:::note
You can configure your preferred IDE.
Refer to __[Set the Default IDE](#set-the-default-ide)__ for more information.
:::

## Delete a Workspace
You can delete an existing Workspace.

__Prerequisites__
*   A working installation of Daytona.
*   At least 1 existing Workspace.

__Procedure__
1.  Run the following command:
    ```shell
    $ daytona delete
    ```
2.  Select the desired Workspace for deletion in the list and hit `Enter`.
3.  Confirm the action.

## IDEs
Daytona allows you to connect to your Workspace using your preferred IDE.
Out of the box, Daytona can be configured to open your Workspace in the following IDEs:

*   Visual Studio Code (VSCode)
    *   Desktop (Linux, macOS, Windows)
    *   Browser
*   JetBrains IDEs
    *   CLion
    *   GoLand
    *   IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate
    *   PhpStorm
    *   Rider
    *   RubyMine
    *   WebStorm
*   Terminal SSH

### Set the Default IDE
You can set the default IDE used by Daytona.
After setting the default IDE, it will be opened automatically and connected to your Workspace when using the `daytona code` command.

__Prerequisites__
*   A working installation of Daytona.

__Procedure__
1.  Execute the following command to enter the IDE selection terminal UI:
    ```shell
    daytona ide
    ```
2.  Select your preferred IDE from the list presented.

:::note
When using the `daytona code` command with `VS Code - Browser` as your default IDE, Daytona will install OpenVSCode Server inside your project, forward the appropriate port to your local machine, and open your default browser automatically.
:::

### Forward Ports from a Workspace
Daytona supports flexible port forwarding, allowing you to access services running in a Workspace locally or via a shareable public URL.
With port forwarding, you can work on your project in a Workspace and test your code externally.

#### Access a Port Locally
You can access services running in a Workspace on your local machine.

__Prerequisites__
*   A working installation of Daytona.
*   A running Workspace with at least 1 service accessible via TCP/UDP.

__Procedure__
1.  Execute the following command to forward a port from a running Workspace to your local machine:
    ```shell
    daytona forward <PORT> <WORKSPACE> <PROJECT>
    ```

    __Example: allow local access to port 4321 of the `example-dev-env` Workspace__
    ```shell
    daytona forward 4321 example-dev-env
    ```

#### Access a Port via Public URL
You can access services running in a Workspace via a generated public URL.
This allows you to share your work with others in real-time.

__Prerequisites__
*   A working installation of Daytona.
*   A running Workspace with at least 1 service accessible via TCP/UDP.

__Procedure__
1.  Execute the following command to generate a public URL for a port on a running Workspace:
    ```shell
    daytona forward <PORT> <WORKSPACE> <PROJECT> --public
    ```

    __Example: generate a URL to access port 4321 of the `example-dev-env` Workspace__
    ```shell
    daytona forward 4321 example-dev-env --public
    ```

<Aside type="tip">
Alternatively, you can generate a public URL by executing the following command in a Workspace's shell:

```shell
daytona forward <PORT> --public
```

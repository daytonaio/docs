Workspaces serve as isolated environments containing your project’s codebase, dependencies, packages, and configuration, providing a consistent and reproducible setup for development, testing, and deployment.

They ensure that changes in one project do not inadvertently affect another, promoting a more stable and reliable workflow. This is particularly beneficial in collaborative settings, as it ensures that all team members are working with the same configuration, reducing the likelihood of environment-related issues.

## Create a Workspace

Creating your own Workspace in Daytona is a straightforward process that ensures you have a dedicated environment for your projects.

**Prerequisite**

- **At least [one Target configured](/configuration/targets)**.

  Targets are essential for deploying your Workspaces, so make sure you have configured at least one.

### From a Git Repository

Creating a Workspace allows you to set up a new environment either by selecting a repository from a configured Git provider like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or Gitea, or by manually entering a Git repository URL.

1. Run the following command to start the guided Workspace creation process:

```shell
daytona create
```

<Aside type="tip">
You can open a new Workspace in an [IDE](/usage/ide) by using the `--code` flag.

```shell
daytona create --code
```

</Aside>

<br />

2. To create a Daytona Workspace, select one of the three provided options:

- **Select from a List of Repositories**

   If you choose a Git provider (e.g., GitHub), you will be presented with a list of your repositories from which you can select the desired repository.

- **Enter a Custom Repository URL**

   Alternatively, you can select the option to enter a custom repository URL manually if the repository is not listed under your Git provider account or is from an external source.

- **Create from Sample**

     If you do not have a repository ready, you can choose to create a Workspace from a sample project provided by Daytona. This option allows you to set up a new development environment using quick-start templates.

```text
Choose a Provider
3 items
===
GitHub
Enter a custom repository URL
Create from Sample
```

3. Select the Git repository from the list, enter the URL of the Git repository you want to link with your Workspace, or choose to create a Workspace from a sample project.

4. Enter a name for your Workspace.

<Aside type="note">
   You can press `F10` to configure advanced settings for your Workspace,
   including setting the [Builder](/usage/builders).
</Aside>

<br />

5. Wait while Daytona sets up your Workspace. It handles all the initialization and configuration of your environment.

```text
WORKSPACE | ✓ Request submitted
WORKSPACE | ✓ Creating workspace daytona
daytona   | Creating project daytona
daytona   | Pulling image...
daytona   | Pulling from daytonaio/workspace-project
...
daytona   | Project daytona created
daytona   | Starting project daytona
daytona   | Project daytona started
```

### From an Arbitrary Git URL

Creating a Workspace from an arbitrary Git URL allows you to set up a new environment by directly specifying the URL of the remote repository. This method is useful for setting up environments that are not linked to a pre-configured Git Provider in Daytona.

1. Run the following command to create a Workspace from a remote Git repository:

```shell
daytona create <REPO_URL>
```

**Example**

```shell
daytona create https://github.com/daytonaio/daytona.git
```

Upon running this command, Daytona will clone the specified Git repository and set up a new Workspace based on its contents. You will see progress information in the terminal, indicating the process of the Workspace creation. Once complete, the Workspace will be ready for use with the specified repository.

```text
WORKSPACE | ✓ Request submitted
WORKSPACE | ✓ Creating workspace daytona
daytona   | Creating project daytona
daytona   | Pulling image...
daytona   | Pulling from daytonaio/workspace-project
...
daytona   | Project daytona created
daytona   | Starting project daytona
daytona   | Project daytona started
```

<Aside type="tip">
You can set the Project Builder at Workspace creation time using command-line
flags. Refer to **[Builders](/usage/builders)** for more information.
</Aside>

## List Workspaces

Daytona allows you to keep track of your development environments by listing all previously created Workspaces. This helps you manage multiple projects and ensure that you can easily access and maintain your Workspaces.

1. Run the following command:

```shell
daytona list
```

Upon running this command, Daytona will display a list of your Workspaces with their details. You will be able to see the Workspace name, the repository it is connected to, the target of the Workspace, and its status.

```text
Workspace        Repository          Target     Status
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
MyWorkspace      username/MyProject  local      RUNNING (30 minutes)
```

## Open An Existing Workspace

Daytona allows you to open an existing Workspace in your IDE. This enables you to quickly access and work on your projects in your preferred development environment. With Daytona, you can effortlessly switch between different Workspaces and maintain an efficient workflow.

1. Run the following command:

```shell
daytona code
```

Upon running this command, Daytona will display a list of your Workspaces with their details. You will be able to see the Workspace name, the unique identifier of the Workspace, and the repository it is connected to.

```text
Select a Workspace To Open
1 item

┃  MyProject
┃  abcdefg12hi3 (local)
┃  github.com/username/MyProject.git
```

2. Select the Workspace you want to open.

:::note
You can configure Daytona to use your preferred IDE.
Refer to **[Set the Default IDE](/usage/ide#set-the-default-ide)** for more information.
:::

## Delete Workspaces

Daytona allows you to delete one or more Workspaces, helping you manage your development environments by removing those that are no longer needed.

1. Run the following command:

```shell
daytona delete
```

Upon running this command, Daytona will display a list of your Workspaces with their details. You will be able to see the Workspace name, the unique identifier of the Workspace, and the repository it is connected to.

```text
Select Workspaces To Delete
1 item

┃ MyWorkspace
┃ abcdefg12hi3 (local)
┃ github.com/username/MyProject.git
```

2. Mark Workspaces for deletion by highlighting them and pressing `x`.

3. Press `Enter` on the selected Workspace to delete it.

```text
Delete: MyWorkspace

┃  abcdefg12hi3 (local)
┃  github.com/username/MyProject.git
```

4. Confirm the action.

```text
Delete workspace(s): [MyWorkspace]?
Are you sure you want to delete the workspace(s): [MyWorkspace]?

[Yes]   [No]
```

```text
Workspace MyWorkspace successfully deleted
```

### Non-Interactively

Daytona allows you to delete one or more existing Workspaces non-interactively, allowing for quick and automated cleanup of your development environments without manual selection.

1. Run the following command, specifying the workspace names/UUIDs to delete:

```shell
daytona delete WORKSPACE_1 WORKSPACE_2
```

Upon running this command, Daytona will prompt you to confirm the deletion of the specified Workspace. You will be able to see the Workspace name that you are about to delete, and you will have the option to confirm or cancel the action.

```text
Delete workspace(s): [MyWorkspace]?
Are you sure you want to delete the workspace(s): [MyWorkspace]?

[Yes]   [No]
```

2. Confirm the action to delete the selected Workspace.

```text
Workspace MyWorkspace successfully deleted
```

## Forward Ports from a Workspace

Daytona supports flexible port forwarding, allowing you to access services running in a Workspace locally or via a shareable public URL.
With port forwarding, you can work on your project in a Workspace and test your code externally.

### Access a Port Locally

You can access services running in a Workspace on your local machine.

**Prerequisite**

- A running Workspace with at least one service accessible via TCP/UDP.

1. Run the following command to forward a port from a running Workspace to your local machine:

```shell
daytona forward <PORT> <WORKSPACE> <PROJECT>
```

**Example:** Allow local access to port 4321 of the `example-dev-env` Workspace.

```shell
daytona forward 4321 example-dev-env
```

Upon running this command, Daytona will establish a port forwarding connection from the specified port in the Workspace to your local machine. The terminal will display a message indicating the local port where the forwarded connection is available:

```text
Port available at http://localhost:4321
```

### Access a Port via Public URL

You can access services running in a Workspace via a generated public URL.
This allows you to share your work with others in real-time.

:::note
This feature uses a free public proxy service hosted by Daytona Platforms, Inc.
By using this feature, you acknowledge that your data is processed in accordance with Daytona's [Privacy Policy](https://www.daytona.io/company/privacy-policy) and [Terms of Service](https://www.daytona.io/company/terms-of-service).
:::

**Prerequisite**

- A running Workspace with at least one service accessible via TCP/UDP.

1. Run the following command to generate a public URL for a port on a running Workspace:

```shell
daytona forward <PORT> <WORKSPACE> <PROJECT> --public
```

**Example:** Generate a URL to access port 4321 of the `example-dev-env` Workspace.

```shell
daytona forward 4321 example-dev-env --public
```

Upon running this command, Daytona will first establish a local port forwarding connection and display a message indicating the local port where the forwarded connection is available.

```text
Port available at http://localhost:4321
```

Then, Daytona will proceed to forward the port to a public URL. The terminal will display progress information and, upon completion, provide the generated public URL.

```text
Forwarding port to a public URL...
Port available at:
https://4321-ABC1DeF2GhI3JkLmNoP4RSTuVZ5.try-eu.daytona.app
```

This URL can be shared with others to provide real-time access to the service running on the specified port in your Workspace.

<Aside type="tip">
Alternatively, you can generate a public URL by executing the following command in a Workspace's shell:

```shell
daytona forward <PORT> --public
```

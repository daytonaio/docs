A Target is an isolated processing unit where Workspaces are executed. It can operate on various infrastructures, including cloud-based and on-premises environments. Targets provide the necessary compute resources and meet security requirements within the defined infrastructure.

## Create a Target

Daytona provides an option to create a Target. Creating a Target requires creating a Target Configuration and specifying the Provider to use.

```shell
daytona target create
```

If you have not previously installed a Provider, registered a Runner, or created a Target Configuration, Dayona will prompt you to complete these steps before creating a Target.

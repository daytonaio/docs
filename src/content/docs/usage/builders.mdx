Builders are responsible for creating a container image with everything you need to be productive.
Daytona provides control over how the resulting Project environment is created, allowing you to choose your preferred method to pull in your project's tools, dependencies, and configuration.

When [creating a Workspace](./workspaces#create-a-workspace), you can choose between the following Builders during the Advanced Configuration step:

1.  [__Automatic__](#automatic)  
    Daytona builds the Project image after auto-detecting the most appropriate Builder.
2.  [__Dev Container__](#dev-container)  
    Daytona builds the Project image according to the Dev Container configuration located in the project.
3.  [__Custom Image__](#custom-image)  
    Daytona builds the Project image using an image you specify.
4.  [__None__](#none)  
    Daytona creates the Project using the default base image.

## Supported Builders
### Automatic
Daytona can auto-detect the most appropriate Builder for your project.
When choosing this option, Daytona uses the following logic to determine which Builder to use:

1.  Check if a Dev Container configuration is present at `.devcontainer.json` or `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`, relative to the repository root.
2.  If present, use the [Dev Container Builder](#dev-container).
3.  If not present, use the [None Builder](#none).

### Dev Container
You can build the Project image using the Dev Container standard.
The following options are accepted when using this Builder:

1.  __Devcontainer file path__  
    The path where the Dev Container configuration is located, relative to the repository root.
    The default value is `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`.

<Aside type="tip">
For guidance on how to add Dev Container configuration to your project's repository, refer to Daytona's [Creating a Development Container](https://www.daytona.io/dotfiles/creating-a-development-container) guide.

For more information on the Dev Container standard, refer to the official documentation at [containers.dev](https://containers.dev/).

### Custom Image
You can build the Project image by specifying a custom base container.
The following options are accepted when using this Builder:

1.  __Custom container image__  
    The name of the base container image for the Project.
2.  __Container user__  
    The user to execute commands as during the image build process.
3.  __Post start commands__  
    Commands to execute once the Project is started.
4.  __Environment variables__  
    A list of environment variables  in the format `KEY=VALUE`.

### None
Daytona can build a Project using the default base image.
Unless otherwise configured using `daytona server configure`, the default base image is set to `daytonaio/workspace-project`.

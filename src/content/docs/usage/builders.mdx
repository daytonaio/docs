Builders are responsible for creating a container image with everything you need to be productive.
Daytona provides control over how the resulting Project environment is created, allowing you to choose your preferred method to pull in your project's tools, dependencies, and configuration.

When [creating a Workspace](./workspaces#create-a-workspace), you can choose between the following Builders during the Advanced Configuration step:

1. [**Automatic**](#automatic-builder)  
   Daytona builds the Project image after auto-detecting the most appropriate Builder.
2. [**Dev Container**](#dev-container-builder)  
   Daytona builds the Project image according to the Dev Container configuration located in the project.
3. [**Custom Image**](#custom-image-builder)  
   Daytona builds the Project image using an image you specify.
4. [**None**](#none)  
   Daytona creates the Project using the default base image.

## Automatic Builder

Daytona can auto-detect the most appropriate Builder for your project.
When choosing this option, Daytona uses the following logic to determine which Builder to use:

1. Check if a Dev Container configuration is present at `.devcontainer.json` or `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`, relative to the repository root.
2. If present, use the [Dev Container Builder](#dev-container-builder).
3. If not present, use the [None Builder](#none).

## Dev Container Builder

You can build the Project image using the Dev Container standard.
The following options are accepted when using this Builder:

1. **Devcontainer file path**  
   The path where the Dev Container configuration is located, relative to the repository root.
   The default value is `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`.

<Aside type="tip">
For guidance on how to add Dev Container configuration to your project's repository, refer to Daytona's [Creating a Development Container](https://www.daytona.io/dotfiles/creating-a-development-container) guide.

For more information on the Dev Container standard, refer to the official documentation at [containers.dev](https://containers.dev/).

## Custom Image Builder

You can build the Project image by specifying a custom base container.
The following options are accepted when using this Builder:

1. **Custom container image**  
   The name of the base container image for the Project.
2. **Container user**  
   The user to execute commands as during the image build process.
3. **Post start commands**  
   Commands to execute once the Project is started.
4. **Environment variables**  
   A list of environment variables in the format `KEY=VALUE`.

## None

Daytona can build a Project using the default base image.
Unless otherwise configured using `daytona server configure`, the default base image is set to `daytonaio/workspace-project`.

## Setting a Custom Build Registry

You can set a custom build registry for images built by a Daytona builder.
After an image is built, it will be uploaded to the configured container registry to speed up future Workspace creation for the same Project.

**Prerequisites**

- A working installation of Daytona.
- An account on an accessible container registry with permission to push/pull images.

**Procedure**

1. Execute the following command to configure the custom build registry:

   ```shell
   daytona container-registry set
   ```

2. Set the required options:
   1. **Server URL**  
      The full URL to your custom container registry.
   2. **Username**  
      The username Daytona should use to log in to the container registry.
   3. **Password**  
      The password for your container registry account.
3. Press `Enter` to set the custom build registry.
4. Execute the following command to configure the server:

   ```shell
   daytona server configure
   ```

5. Press `Enter` until the "Builder Registry" section is highlighted.
6. Select the custom registry configured previously using `Up`/`Down`.
7. Press `Enter` until the command exits to save the configuration.

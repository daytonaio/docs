Daytona allows you to connect to your Workspace using your preferred IDE.

Out of the box, Daytona can be configured to open your Workspace in the following IDEs:

- **Visual Studio Code (VSCode)**

  - Desktop (Linux, macOS, Windows)
  - Browser

- **JetBrains IDEs**
  - CLion
  - GoLand
  - IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate
  - PhpStorm
  - Rider
  - RubyMine
  - WebStorm

- **Terminal SSH**

## Set the Default IDE

You can set the default IDE used by Daytona.

1. Run the following command to set the default IDE:

   ```shell
   daytona ide
   ```

   Upon running this command, Daytona will display a list of available IDEs, allowing you to select your default choice.

   ```text
        Choose Your Default IDE

        VS Code
        VS Code - Browser
        Terminal SSH
        CLion
        GoLand
        ...
   ```

2. Select your preferred IDE from the list presented. Upon selecting, Daytona will set it as the default IDE and display a confirmation message.

   ```text
       Default IDE:  VS Code
   ```

   You can now use the `daytona code` command to automatically open the default IDE already connected to your Workspace.

:::note
When using the `daytona code` command with `VS Code - Browser` as your default IDE, Daytona will install OpenVSCode Server inside your project, forward the appropriate port to your local machine, and open your default browser automatically.

Daytona is an open-source Development Environment Manager (DEM) licensed under the Apache License 2.0.
Daytona allows you to manage and deploy Workspaces â€” reproducible development environments based on standard OCI containers, with built-in support for the Dev Container standard.
Daytona's architecture provides the future possibility to base Workspaces on other configuration standards, such as Dockerfiles, Docker Compose, Nix, and Devfile.

By leveraging configuration in a project's remote Git repository, Daytona builds a Workspace and provisions a workspace to a platform of your choice.
Once provisioned, you can develop and test the project using an IDE supported by Daytona, such as Visual Studio Code.

Daytona's functionality is exposed through a command-line tool that runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows systems, on both x86-64 and AArch64 architectures.

## Features
*   __Security__  
    Daytona creates a secure VPN connection between the client machine and the remote machine.
    All ports on the remote machine can be accessed securely without the need for manual port forwarding.
*   __Support for Visual Studio Code and JetBrains__   
    Daytona supports both Visual Studio Code and the JetBrains line of IDEs, making it easy to develop your project while feeling like everything's local.
*   __Connect with GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and Gitea__  
    Daytona can create DEs by pulling repositories from your preferred SCM platform. Git operations can be executed within a workspace, allowing you to push your work without context switching.
*   __Support for Multi-Project Workspaces__  
    Daytona is capable of creating workspaces with multiple projects.
    Large projects split into micro-services or multiple repositories can be worked on using a single workspace.
*   __Reverse Proxy Support__  
    Daytona integrates a reverse proxy allowing you to access a workspace on a public or restricted network.
*   __Extensible Core__  
    Daytona supports plugins developed in Go.
    Third-party Providers can be added to Daytona, as well as extensions to core functionality.

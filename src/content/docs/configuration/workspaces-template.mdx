A Workspace Template is designed to simplify the management of development environments, allowing you to predefine settings that can be easily applied to any new or existing Workspace.

A Workspace Template contains all necessary properties to define and manage Workspaces within a Workspace. It stores information such as the repository URL, build configuration, and environment variables. This allows for easy reuse of previously set templates, ensuring a consistent and reproducible setup across multiple Workspaces.

A Workspace Template encapsulates all the essential elements for setting up a Workspace, including:

- **Repository URL**

   The URL of the Git repository associated with the Workspace.

- **Build Configuration**

  - [Automatic](/docs/usage/builders#automatic) auto-detects the most appropriate Builder for your Workspace.
  - [Devcontainer](/docs/usage/builders#dev-container) utilizes a predefined development container specified by a `devcontainer.json` file.
  - [Custom image](/docs/usage/builders#custom-image) builds the Workspace image by specifying a custom base container.
  - [None](/docs/usage/builders#none) builds a Workspace by using the default base image (`daytonaio/workspace-project`).

- **Environment Variables**

   Environment variables are specified in the `KEY=VALUE` format. These variables are essential for the Workspace's build and runtime environments. You can set the variables directly or pass them from the machine's environment during execution.

- **Workspace Template name**

   A unique identifier for the Workspace Template, which distinguishes it from other Template within the system.

With the `daytona workspace-template` command, you can add, view, update, list, set as default, or delete Workspace Templates, giving you full control over the Template and reuse of your Workspace setups across different Workspaces.

## Add a Workspace Template

Daytona allows you to add a new Workspace Template, enabling you to store and reuse Workspace properties across multiple Workspaces.

1. Run the following command to add a new Workspace Template:

```shell
daytona workspace-template add
```

2. Enter the repository URL of the Workspace you want to configure.

```text
Git repository
>
```

3. Select the build configuration for the Workspace.

```text
Choose a build configuration
Automatic
Devcontainer
Custom image
None
```

4. Enter the environment variables for the Workspace in the `KEY=VALUE` format.

```text
Environment Variables
Enter environment variables in the format KEY=VALUE
To pass machine env variables at runtime, use $VALUE
```

5. Enter a name for the Workspace Template.

```text
Workspace Template name
>
```

   Upon completion, Daytona will save the Workspace Template, allowing you to reuse it across multiple Workspaces.

## Workspace Template Information

Daytona allows you to view detailed information of a Workspace Template, providing you with an overview of the properties stored within it.

1. Run the following command to view the details of a Workspace Template:

```shell
daytona workspace-template info
```

Upon running this command, Daytona will display a list of your Workspace Templates.

2. Select the Workspace Template you want to view.

```text
Select a Workspace Config To View
1 item
┃  MyWorkspaceConfig
┃  https://github.com/username/MyWorkspace
```

   Upon selecting the Workspace Template, Daytona will display the details of the selected Template. You will be able to view the Workspace Template name, the repository URL it is linked to, the build configuration, and the Devcontainer path.

```text
Workspace Config Info
Name                    MyWorkspaceConfig
Repository              https://github.com/username/MyWorkspace
Build                   Devcontainer
Devcontainer path       .devcontainer/devcontainer.json
```

## List Workspace Templates

Daytona allows you to list all Workspace Templates, providing you with an overview of the properties stored within each Template.

1. Run the following command to list all Workspace Templates:

```shell
daytona workspace-template list
```

Upon running this command, Daytona will display a list of your Workspace Templates. You will be able to view the Workspace Template name, the repository URL it is connected to, the build configuration, and if it is set as a default Template.

```text
Name                  Repository            Build            Default
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
MyWorkspaceConfig     daytonaio/daytona     Devcontainer     Yes
```

## Set Default Workspace Template

Daytona allows you to set a default Workspace Template, enabling you to define a Template that will be used by default when creating new Workspaces.

1. Run the following command to set a default Workspace Template:

```shell
daytona workspace-template set-default
```

2. Select the Workspace Template you want to set as the default.

```text
Select a Workspace Template To Set As Default
1 item
┃  MyWorkspaceTemplate
┃  https://github.com/username/MyWorkspace
```

   Upon selecting the default Workspace Template, Daytona will set it as the default Template for new Workspaces.

```text
Workspace Template 'MyWorkspaceTemplate' set as default
```

## Update Workspace Template

Daytona allows you to update an existing Workspace Template, enabling you to modify the properties stored within it.

1. Run the following command to update a Workspace Template:

```shell
daytona workspace-template update
```

2. Select the Workspace Template you want to update.

```text
Select a Workspace Template To Update
1 item
┃  MyWorkspaceTemplate
┃  https://github.com/username/MyWorkspace
```

3. Update the properties of the Workspace Template.

```text
Choose a build configuration
Automatic
Devcontainer
Custom image
None
```

```text
Environment Variables
Enter environment variables in the format KEY=VALUE
To pass machine env variables at runtime, use $VALUE
```

Upon completion, Daytona will save the updated Workspace Template, allowing you to reuse it across Workspaces.

```text
Workspace Template updated successfully
```

## Delete Workspace Template

Daytona allows you to delete an existing Workspace Template, enabling you to remove properties that are no longer needed.

1. Run the following command to delete a Workspace Template:

```shell
daytona workspace-template delete
```

2. Select the Workspace Template you want to delete.

```text
Select a Workspace Template To Delete
1 item
┃  MyWorkspaceTemplate
┃  https://github.com/username/MyWorkspace
```

```text
Workspace Template deleted successfully
```

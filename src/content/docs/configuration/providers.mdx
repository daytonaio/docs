Providers are plugins through which Daytona integrates with various technologies to create and manage development environments. Providers abstract complexities of underlying technologies and serve as the foundational engines that Daytona leverages to deploy and run your environments, whether through containerization, orchestration, or cloud-based virtual machines.

Daytona's architecture decentralizes the role of a Provider into a separate service. The [Daytona Server](/docs/usage/server) communicates with Providers to execute operations relating to Workspace creation and lifecycle management.

## Install a Provider

Daytona provides an option to install a Provider to interface with the Daytona Server. Once a new Provider is installed, it manages the Workspace deployment and its lifecycle management.

1. Run the following command to install a Provider:

```shell
daytona provider install
```

:::note
Daytona will prompt you select a [Runner](/docs/usage/runners) to manage the Provider.

2. Select the Provider you want to install from the list or select a specific version.

```text

v0.0.0
Azure
v0.0.0
GCP
v0.0.0
Hetzner
v0.0.0
Fly

```

Upon selecting the Provider, Daytona will install and configure the chosen Provider, making it available for managing and deploying Workspaces. You can now create a [Target](/docs/usage/targets) to use with the created Provider.

## List Providers

Daytona provides an option to list all installed Providers, providing you with an overview of the Providers available for managing Workspaces.

<br />
To create a service principal with the `Contributor` role, use the following Azure CLI command:
<br />

```shell
az ad sp create-for-rbac --role Contributor --scopes /subscriptions/<subscription-id>

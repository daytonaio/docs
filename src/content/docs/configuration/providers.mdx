Daytona abstracts the management and deployment of Workspaces into 2 related concepts:

1. **Provider**  
    A plugin that interfaces with the [Daytona Server](/usage/server), responsible for Workspace deployment and lifecycle management.
    Examples of platforms Providers may connect with include:
    - Container management platforms such as Docker or Podman;
    - Cloud hosting providers such as AWS or DigitalOcean.
2. **Target**  
    A set of configuration that governs how Daytona manages and deploys Workspaces.
    Each Target is tied to an individual Provider.
    Daytona allows you to configure new and existing Targets, and choose between them at Workspace creation time.

Daytona's architecture decentralizes the role of a Provider into a separate service.
The [Daytona Server](/usage/server) communicates with Providers to execute operations relating to Workspace creation and lifecycle management.

This makes it possible to create new Providers to govern Workspace management on any platform or hosting providers.

## Managing Providers

### Install a Provider

Daytona allows you to install a Provider to interface with the Daytona Server. Once a new Provider is installed, it manages Workspace deployment and lifecycle management.

1. Run the following command to start the guided Providers installation:

    ```shell
    daytona provider install
    ```

2. Select the Provider you want to install from the list or select a specific version.

    ```text
        Choose a provider to install
        5 items
        ===
        fly-provider
        v0.0.0
        aws-provider
        v0.0.0
        docker-provider
        v0.0.0
        digitalocean-provider
        v0.0.0

        Select a specific version
    ```

    Upon selecting the Provider, Daytona will install and configure the chosen Provider, making it available for managing and deploying Workspaces. You can now create a [Target](#managing-targets) to use with the created Provider.

    ```text
        Provider docker-provider has been successfully installed
    ```

### Uninstall a Provider

Daytona allows you to uninstall an existing Provider, helping you manage your Providers by removing those that are no longer needed.

1. Run the following command to uninstall a Provider:

    ```shell
    daytona provider uninstall
    ```

2. Select the Provider you want to uninstall from the list.

    ```text
        Choose a provider to uninstall
        1 item
        ===
        │ docker-provider
        │ v0.0.0
    ```

    ```text
        Provider docker-provider has been successfully uninstalled
    ```

### Update a Provider

Daytona allows you to update an existing Provider, enabling you to apply the latest enhancements and bug fixes.

    ```

2. Select the appropriate Provider for the environment you want to deploy to.

    ```text
        Choose a provider
        1 item
        ===
        │ docker-provider
        │ v0.0.0
    ```

3. Select `New Target`.
4. Enter a name for your Target.
5. Enter the appropriate configuration options when prompted.

    ```text
        Remote Password

        Remote User
        Note: non-root user required
        >

        Sock Path
        > /var/run/docker.sock

        Workspace Data Dir       
        The directory on the remote host where the workspace data will be stored
        > /tmp/daytona-data

        Remote Private Key Path
        daytona_config
        known_hosts
        Custom path
        None
    ```

6. Click `Enter` to confirm setting the Target.

    ```text
        Target set successfully
     ```

### List Targets

Daytona allows you to keep track of your Targets by listing all previously created Targets with their details.

1. Run the following command to list currently set Targets:

   ```shell
   daytona target list
   ```

   Upon running this command, Daytona will display a list of your Targets with their details. You will be able to see the Target name, the Provider it is connected to, and its configured options.

   ```text
    Target      Provider            Options
    ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    MyTarget    docker-provider     {
                                        "Sock Path": "/var/run/docker.sock"
                                    }
   ```

### Delete a Target

Daytona allows you to delete Targets, helping you manage and remove those that are no longer needed. Once a Target is deleted, you will not be able to manage or deploy Workspaces on that Target.

1. Run the following command:

    ```shell
    daytona target delete
    ```

    Upon running this command, Daytona will display a list of your Targets with their details. You will be able to see the Target name, the unique identifier of the Workspace, and the repository it is connected to.

2. Press `Enter` on the selected Target to delete it.

    ```text
        Choose a Target
        1 item
        ===
        │ MyTarget          
        │ docker-provider
    ```

3. Confirm the action.

    ```text
        ┃ Delete all workspaces within MyTarget?
        ┃ You might not be able to easily remove these workspaces later.
        ┃
        ┃   [Yes]     [No]
    ```

    ```text
        Target MyTarget removed successfully
    ```

## Officially Supported Providers

### Docker

After installation, Daytona installs a Provider for Docker (`daytona-provider-docker`) by default.
A default Target using the Docker Provider is also added, allowing the creation of Workspaces on your local machine.

#### Add a Target

When using Docker as a Provider, you have the choice of creating either a local or remote target:

- **[Remote](#remote)**  
  The target uses a remote installation of Docker to deploy Workspaces.
  This requires access to an SSH daemon on the desired host machine, and access to a user with permission to create Docker containers.
- **[Local](#local)**  
  The target uses your local installation of Docker to deploy Workspaces.
  This allows you to use Daytona without needing external servers or infrastructure.

##### Remote

You can add a target for an installation of Docker on a remote host.
When following the [Set a Target procedure](#set-a-target), note the following configuration options:

1. **Container Image**

    The base image used by Daytona to deploy new Workspaces.
    The default value is `daytonaio/workspace-project`.

2. **Remote Hostname**

    The hostname of the remote host.
3. **Remote Password**

    The password for the remote user.
    If password authentication is disabled on the remote host, you can choose an SSH key in the next step.
4. **Remote Port**

    The TCP port used to access the remote host's SSH daemon.
    Unless otherwise configured on your remote host, this should be set to the default value (`22`)
5. **Remote User**

     The username used to execute the required commands on the remote host.

    <br />

    <Aside type="caution">
      Non-root user is required so correct ownership is assumed inside the
      project container.
    </Aside>

    <br />

6. **Sock Path**

    The Docker UNIX socket location on the remote host.
    Unless otherwise configured after installing Docker, this should be set to the default value (`/var/run/docker.sock`)
7. **Remote Private Key Path**

    The SSH private key used to connect to the remote host.
    If you are using password authentication, you can choose "None".

Providers are plugins through which Daytona integrates with various technologies to create and manage development environments. Providers abstract complexities of underlying technologies and serve as the foundational engines that Daytona leverages to deploy and run your environments, whether through containerization, orchestration, or cloud-based virtual machines.

Daytona's architecture decentralizes the role of a Provider into a separate service. The [Daytona Server](/usage/server) communicates with Providers to execute operations relating to Workspace creation and lifecycle management.

## Install a Provider

Daytona allows you to install a Provider to interface with the Daytona Server. Once a new Provider is installed, it manages Workspace deployment and lifecycle management.

1. Run the following command to install a Provider:

    ```shell
    daytona provider install
    ```

2. Select the Provider you want to install from the list or select a specific version.

    ```text
        Choose a provider to install
        5 items
        ===
        fly-provider
        v0.0.0
        aws-provider
        v0.0.0
        docker-provider
        v0.0.0
        digitalocean-provider
        v0.0.0

        Select a specific version
    ```

    Upon selecting the Provider, Daytona will install and configure the chosen Provider, making it available for managing and deploying Workspaces. You can now create a [Target](/configuration/targets) to use with the created Provider.

    ```text
        Provider docker-provider has been successfully installed
    ```

## Update a Provider

Daytona allows you to update an existing Provider, enabling you to apply the latest enhancements and bug fixes.

1. Run the following command to update a Provider:

    ```shell
    daytona provider update
    ```

2. Select the Provider you want to update from the list.

    ```text
        Choose a provider to update
        1 item
        ===
        docker-provider
        v0.0.0
    ```

    ```text
        Provider docker-provider has been successfully updated
    ```

## Uninstall a Provider

Daytona allows you to uninstall an existing Provider, helping you manage your Providers by removing those that are no longer needed.

1. Run the following command to uninstall a Provider:

    ```shell
    daytona provider uninstall
    ```

2. Select the Provider you want to uninstall from the list.

    ```text
        Choose a provider to uninstall
        1 item
        ===
        docker-provider
        v0.0.0
    ```

    ```text
        Provider docker-provider has been successfully uninstalled
    ```

## Docker

After installation, Daytona installs a Provider for Docker (`daytona-provider-docker`) by default.
A default Target using the Docker Provider is also added, allowing the creation of Workspaces on your local machine.

### Add a Target

When using Docker as a Provider, you have the choice of creating either a local or remote [Target](/configuration/targets):

- **[Remote](#remote)**  
  The target uses a remote installation of Docker to deploy Workspaces.
  This requires access to an SSH daemon on the desired host machine, and access to a user with permission to create Docker containers.
- **[Local](#local)**  
  The target uses your local installation of Docker to deploy Workspaces.
  This allows you to use Daytona without needing external servers or infrastructure.

#### Remote

You can add a target for an installation of Docker on a remote host.
When following the [set a Target](/configuration/targets#set-a-target) procedure, note the following configuration options:

1. **Container Image**

    The base image used by Daytona to deploy new Workspaces.
    The default value is `daytonaio/workspace-project`.

2. **Remote Hostname**

    The hostname of the remote host.
3. **Remote Password**

    The password for the remote user.
    If password authentication is disabled on the remote host, you can choose an SSH key in the next step.
4. **Remote Port**

    The TCP port used to access the remote host's SSH daemon.
    Unless otherwise configured on your remote host, this should be set to the default value (`22`)
5. **Remote User**

     The username used to execute the required commands on the remote host.

    <br />

    <Aside type="caution">
      Non-root user is required so correct ownership is assumed inside the
      project container.
    </Aside>

    <br />

6. **Sock Path**

    The Docker UNIX socket location on the remote host.
    Unless otherwise configured after installing Docker, this should be set to the default value (`/var/run/docker.sock`)
7. **Remote Private Key Path**

    The SSH private key used to connect to the remote host.
    If you are using password authentication, you can choose "None".

#### Local

By default, Daytona comes pre-configured with a local Docker Target.
If you have removed the default Docker Target, you can recreate it using the [set a Target](/configuration/targets#set-a-target)procedure.

## AWS

The AWS Provider allows Daytona to create and manage Workspace projects on Amazon EC2 instances. This provider integrates Daytona with AWS, enabling you to deploy and manage Workspaces in a scalable and flexible cloud environment.

To use the AWS Provider, ensure that your AWS programmatic access user has the `AmazonEC2FullAccess` permissions. This policy grants the necessary permissions to manage EC2 instances, which is crucial for Daytona's Workspace project creation and management.

### Add a Target

The AWS Provider does not have any default Targets. You must create and configure a [Target](/configuration/targets#set-a-target) before using the Provider. Use the `daytona target set` command to set the Target with the AWS Provider.

When setting up a Target for the AWS Provider, you will need to configure several properties. Below is a breakdown of these properties, their types, and usage:

| Property           | Type   | Optional | Default Value  | Input Masked |
|--------------------|--------|----------|----------------|--------------|
| **Region**         | String | true     | us-east-1      | false        |
| **Image Id**       | String | true     | ami-04a81a99f5ec58529 | false  |
| **Instance Type**  | String | true     | t2.micro       | false        |
| **Device Name**    | String | true     | /dev/sda1      | false        |
| **Volume Size**    | String | true     | 10             | false        |
| **Volume Type**    | String | true     | gp3            | false        |
| **Access Key Id**  | String | false    |                | true         |
| **Secret Access Key** | String | false |               | true         |

These configuration options allow you to customize the AWS environment for your Daytona Workspaces.

Once a Target is set, you can use it to create and manage Workspaces on Amazon EC2 instances, leveraging the full capabilities of AWS for your projects.

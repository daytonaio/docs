Providers are plugins through which Daytona integrates with various technologies to create and manage development environments. Providers abstract complexities of underlying technologies and serve as the foundational engines that Daytona leverages to deploy and run your environments, whether through containerization, orchestration, or cloud-based virtual machines.

Daytona's architecture decentralizes the role of a Provider into a separate service. The [Daytona Server](/docs/usage/server) communicates with Providers to execute operations relating to Workspace creation and lifecycle management.

## Install a Provider

Daytona allows you to install a Provider to interface with the Daytona Server. Once a new Provider is installed, it manages Workspace deployment and lifecycle management.

1. Run the following command to install a Provider:

```shell
daytona provider install
```

2. Select the Provider you want to install from the list or select a specific version.

```text
Choose a provider to install
5 items
===
fly-provider
v0.0.0
aws-provider
v0.0.0
docker-provider
v0.0.0
digitalocean-provider
v0.0.0

Select a specific version
```

Upon selecting the Provider, Daytona will install and configure the chosen Provider, making it available for managing and deploying Workspaces. You can now create a [Target](/docs/configuration/targets) to use with the created Provider.

```text
Provider docker-provider has been successfully installed
```

## List Providers

Daytona allows you to list all installed Providers, providing you with an overview of the Providers available for managing Workspaces.

1. Run the following command to list all installed Providers:

```shell
daytona provider list
```

Upon running this command, Daytona will display a list of your installed Providers and their respective versions.

```text
Name                                Version               
───────────────────────────────────────────
docker-provider                     v.0.0.0
```

## Update a Provider

Daytona allows you to update an existing Provider, enabling you to apply the latest enhancements and bug fixes.

1. Run the following command to update a Provider:

```shell
daytona provider update
```

2. Select the Provider you want to update from the list.

```text
Choose a provider to update
1 item
===
docker-provider
v0.0.0
```

```text
Provider docker-provider has been successfully updated
```

## Uninstall a Provider

Daytona allows you to uninstall an existing Provider, helping you manage your Providers by removing those that are no longer needed.

1. Run the following command to uninstall a Provider:

```shell
daytona provider uninstall
```

2. Select the Provider you want to uninstall from the list.

```text
Choose a provider to uninstall
1 item
===
docker-provider
v0.0.0
```

```text
Provider docker-provider has been successfully uninstalled
```

## Docker

The Docker Provider allows Daytona to create Workspace projects as Docker containers. Daytona installs a Provider for Docker (`docker-provider`) by default and adds a default [Target](/docs/configuration/targets#docker) using the Docker Provider, allowing the creation of Workspaces on your local machine.

1. Run the following command to install a Docker Provider:

```shell
daytona provider install
```

2. Select **`docker-provider`** to install Docker as your Provider.

```text
Choose a provider to install
===

  v0.0.0
```

Upon selecting the Provider, Daytona will install and configure the chosen Provider, making it available for managing and deploying Workspaces.

```text
⡿  Installing...
```

```text
Provider docker-provider has been successfully installed
```

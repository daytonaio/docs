Git Providers — sometimes known as software forges or Source Code Managers (SCMs) — provide a set of tools to host and collaborate on codebases using Git.
Daytona allows you to configure Git Providers and use repositories hosted on them to create Workspaces.

## Add a Git Provider

You can add a Git Provider to Daytona to integrate your version control system with your development workflow. This integration allows Daytona to interact with your repositories, enabling automated processes and continuous integration.

__Prerequisites__

- __A [working installation of Daytona](/installation/installation)__.

  Verify your Daytona installation is up-to-date to avoid compatibility issues.

__Procedure__

1. Run the following command to start the guided Git Provider addition process:

    ```shell
    daytona git-providers add
    ```

    Upon running this command, Daytona will prompt you to select the Git Provider you want to add.

    ```text
        Choose a Git provider
    ┃ > GitHub
        GitLab
        Bitbucket
        Other
    ```

2. Select the Git Provider you want to configure from the list:
    - __[GitHub](#github)__

        Select if you're hosting repositories on GitHub.com.

    - __[GitLab](#gitlab)__

        Select if you're hosting repositories on GitLab.com.

    - __[Bitbucket](#bitbucket)__

        Select if you're hosting repositories on Atlassian's Bitbucket Cloud offering.

    - __Other__

        - __[GitHub Enterprise Server](#github-enterprise-server)__

            Select if you're hosting repositories on GitHub Enterprise Server.

        - __[GitLab Self-Managed](#gitlab-self-managed)__

            Select if you're hosting repositories on GitLab's self-hosted offering.

            Self-hosted GitLab Community Edition (CE) installations, GitLab Self-Managed, and GitLab Dedicated offerings are supported.

        - __[Codeberg](#codeberg)__

            Select if you're hosting repositories on Codeberg.org.

        - __[Gitea](#gitea)__

            Select if you're hosting repositories on an installation of Gitea.

        - __[Gitness](#gitness)__

            Select if you're hosting repositories on a Gitness instance.

3. Enter your Personal Access Token for Daytona to authenticate and enable secure access to your repositories.

    ```text
        Personal access token
        >
    ```

    Some Git Providers might require additional information such as your _username_ or the _URL_ of your self-managed instance to complete the configuration.

    ```text
        Git provider has been registered
    ```

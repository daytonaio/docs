Git Providers — sometimes known as software forges or Source Code Managers (SCMs) — provide a set of tools to host and collaborate on codebases using Git.

Daytona allows you to integrate your preferred Git Provider, enhancing your development workflow. This integration enables you to access and manage your repositories directly within Daytona, simplifying workspace creation from existing projects.

By adding a Git Provider, your credentials are securely embedded into your Workspaces. This allows for seamless Git operations without repeated authentication.

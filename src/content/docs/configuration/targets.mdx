Daytona supports deploying Dev Environments to a specific target, allowing you to host your Dev Environments on the appropriate infrastructure for your use case.
Currently, Daytona supports Docker as a provider for both local and remote targets.

## Add a Docker Target
You can use Docker as a Provider for deploying Dev Environments.
When choosing Docker as a Provider, you have the choice of creating either a local or remote target:

*   __[Remote](#remote)__  
    The target uses a remote installation of Docker to deploy Dev Environments.
    This requires access to an SSH daemon on the desired host machine, and access to a user with permission to create Docker containers.
*   __[Local](#local)__  
    The target uses your local installation of Docker to deploy Dev Environments.
    This allows you to use Daytona without needing external servers or infrastructure.

### Remote
You can add a target for an installation of Docker on a remote host.

__Prerequisites__
*   A working installation of Daytona.
*   A remote host running Linux and Docker.

__Procedure__
1.  Select `New Target` to create a target.
2.  When prompted for a provider, select `docker-provider`.

3.  Configure the following options when promoted:
    1.  __Container Image__  
        The base image used by Daytona to deploy new Dev Environments.
        The default value is `daytonaio/workspace-project`.
    2.  __Remote Hostname__  
        The hostname of the remote host.
    3.  __Remote Password__  
        The password for the remote user.
    4.  __Remote Port__  
        The TCP port used to access the remote host's SSH daemon.
        Unless otherwise configured on your remote host, this should be set to the default value (`22`)
    5.  __Remote User__  
        The username used to execute the required commands on the remote host.
    6.  __Sock Path__  
        The Docker UNIX socket location on the remote host.
        Unless otherwise configured after installing Docker, this should be set to the default value (`/var/run/docker.sock`)
4.  Press `Enter` to add the target.

### Local
You can add a target for your local installation of Docker.

:::note
By default, a fresh installation of Daytona comes pre-configured with a local Docker target enabled.
These instructions are only applicable if you need to recreate the local target after removing it.

2.  Select `New Target` to create a target.
3.  When prompted for a provider, select `docker-provider`.
4.  After selecting the provider, enter `local`.
5.  Leave the default values selected and hit `Enter` to add the target.

## Remove a Target

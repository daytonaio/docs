Targets serve as isolated environments containing your codebase, dependencies, packages, and configuration, providing a consistent and reproducible setup for development, testing, and deployment.

They ensure that changes in one project do not inadvertently affect another, promoting a more stable and reliable workflow. This is particularly beneficial in collaborative settings, as it ensures that all team members are working with the same configuration, reducing the likelihood of environment-related issues.

## Create a Target

Creating a Target in Daytona is a straightforward process that ensures you have a dedicated development environment for your projects.

Daytona provides two primary methods for creating a Target:

- [**From a Git Repository**](#from-a-git-repository)
- [**From an Arbitrary Git URL**](#from-an-arbitrary-git-url)
- [**With Multiple Projects**](#create-a-target-with-multiple-projects)

### From a Git Repository

Creating a Target from a Git repository sets up a new development environment using a [connected Git Provider](/docs/configuration/git-providers) or a custom Git repository URL.

1. Run the following command to create a Target from a Git repository:

```shell
daytona create
```

<Aside type="tip">
Skip automatically opening the Target in an [IDE](/docs/usage/ide) by using the `--no-ide` flag.

```shell
daytona create --no-ide
```

</Aside>

<br />

2. Select one of the three provided options:

- **Select from a List of Repositories**

   If you [connected a Git Provider](/docs/configuration/git-providers), you will be presented with a list of your repositories from which you can select to connect with your Target.

- **Enter a Custom Repository URL**

   Alternatively, select the option to enter a custom repository URL manually if the repository is not listed under your Git Provider account or is from an external source.

- **Create from Sample**

   If you do not have a Git repository ready, you can create a Target from a Sample project provided by Daytona. This option sets up a new development environment using quick-start templates.

```text
Choose a Git Provider
3 items
===
GitHub
Enter a custom repository URL
Create from Sample
```

3. Select the Git repository from the list, enter the URL of the Git repository you want to link with your Target, or choose to create a Target from a sample project.

4. Enter a name for your Target.

```text
Target name
>
```

<Aside type="tip">
   Press `F10` to configure advanced settings for your Target,
   including setting the [Builder](/docs/usage/builders).
</Aside>

<br />

5. Select a Target to deploy your Target to. Selecting a Target will prompt you to input the [Target configuration](/docs/configuration/targets). The configurations vary based on the selected Target.

```text
Choose a Target
6 items
===
local
docker-provider

Add a Docker Provider Target
docker-provider (needs installing)

Add a Digital Ocean Provider Target
digitalocean-provider (needs installing)

Add an AWS Provider Target

gcp-provider (needs installing)

Add an Azure Provider Target
azure-provider (needs installing)

Add a Hetzner Provider Target
hetzner-provider (needs installing)

Add a Fly.io Provider Target
fly-provider (needs installing)
```

Upon Target selection and configuration, Daytona will clone the specified Git repository and set up a new Target based on its contents. You will see progress information in the terminal, indicating the process of creating a Target.

```text
TARGET   | ✓ Request submitted
TARGET   | ✓ Creating target daytona
daytona  | Creating project daytona
daytona  | Pulling image...
daytona  | Pulling from daytonaio/target-project
...
daytona  | Project daytona created
daytona  | Starting project daytona
daytona  | Project daytona started
```

### From an Arbitrary Git URL

Creating a Target from an arbitrary Git URL sets up a new development environment by directly specifying the URL of the remote repository.

1. Run the following command to create a Target from a remote Git repository:

```shell
daytona create <REPO_URL>
```

**Example**

```shell
daytona create https://github.com/daytonaio/daytona.git
```

2. Select a Target to deploy your Target to. Selecting a Target will prompt you to input the [Target configuration](/docs/configuration/targets). The configurations vary based on the selected Target.

```text

Add a Digital Ocean Provider Target
digitalocean-provider (needs installing)

Add an AWS Provider Target
aws-provider (needs installing)

Add an Azure Provider Target
azure-provider (needs installing)
```

Upon Target selection and configuration, Daytona will clone the specified Git repository and set up a new Target based on its contents. You will see progress information in the terminal, indicating the process of creating a Target.

Once complete, the Target will be ready for use with the specified repository and configuration.

```text
TARGET   | ✓ Request submitted
TARGET   | ✓ Creating target daytona
daytona  | Creating project daytona
daytona  | Pulling image...
daytona  | Pulling from daytonaio/target-project
...
daytona  | Project daytona created
daytona  | Starting project daytona
daytona  | Project daytona started
```

<Aside type="tip">
Set the Project Builder at Target creation time using command-line
flags. Refer to **[Builders](/docs/usage/builders)** for more information.
</Aside>

## Create a Target with Multiple Projects

Daytona allows you to create a Target that contains multiple repositories, which we refer to as Projects. This enables you to work on several codebases simultaneously within a single environment.

Multiple projects are deployed within the same virtual machine or instance depending on the [Provider](/docs/configuration/providers) infrastructure, allowing you to manage and develop multiple projects in a unified Target.

- The [Docker Provider](/docs/configuration/providers#docker) deploys each project in its own container.
- The [AWS Provider](/docs/configuration/providers#aws) deploys projects within the same EC2 instance.
- The [DigitalOcean Provider](/docs/configuration/providers#digitalocean) deploys projects within the same Droplet.
- The [Fly Provider](/docs/configuration/providers#fly) deploys projects within the same virtual machine.

Regardless of the infrastructure type, all projects are managed consistently within the Target.

1. Run the following command to create a Target with multiple projects:

```shell
daytona create --multi-project
```

2. Select one of the three provided options:

- **Select from a List of Repositories**

   If you choose a Git provider (e.g., GitHub), you will be presented with a list of your repositories from which you can select the desired repository.

- **Enter a Custom Repository URL**

   Alternatively, select the option to enter a custom repository URL manually if the repository is not listed under your Git provider account or is from an external source.

- **Create from Sample**

     If you do not have a repository ready, choose to create a Target from a sample project provided by Daytona. This option allows you to set up a new development environment using quick-start templates.

```text
Choose a Git Provider
3 items
===
GitHub
Enter a custom repository URL
Create from Sample
```

3. Select the Git repository from the list, enter the URL of the Git repository you want to link with your Target, or choose to create a Target from a sample project.

After your selection, you will be prompted to add a second project to the Target.

```text
Choose a Git Provider (Project #2)
3 items
===
GitHub
Enter a custom repository URL
Create from Sample
```

4. Select the Git repository from the list for the second project, enter the URL of the Git repository you want to link with your Target, or choose to create a Target from a sample project.

After adding the second project, you will be prompted to add another project to the Target.

```text
Add another project?

[Yes] [No]
```

Selecting `Yes` will allow you to add additional projects to the Target. Once you have added all the projects you need, select `No` to complete the Target creation process.

After adding all projects, you will be prompted with a summary of the Target configuration.

```text
SUMMARY

Project #1 - https://github.com/daytonaio/sample-python.git
   Build       Automatic
   Image       daytonaio/target-project:latest
   User        daytona

   Build       Automatic
   Image       daytonaio/target-project:latest
   User        daytona
```

5. Enter a name for your Target.

```text
Target name
>
```

6. Select a Target to deploy your Target to. Selecting a Target will prompt you to input the [Target configuration](/docs/configuration/targets). The configurations vary based on the selected Target.

```text

┃ MyTarget
┃ abcdefg12hi3 (local)
┃ github.com/username/MyProject.git
```

2. Mark Targets for deletion by highlighting them and pressing `x`.

3. Press `Enter` on the selected Target to delete it.

```text
Delete: MyTarget

┃  abcdefg12hi3 (local)
┃  github.com/username/MyProject.git
```

4. Confirm the action.

```text
Delete target(s): [MyTarget]?
Are you sure you want to delete the target(s): [MyTarget]?

[Yes]   [No]
```

```text
Target MyTarget successfully deleted
```

### Non-Interactively

Daytona allows you to delete one or more existing Targets non-interactively, allowing for quick and automated cleanup of your development environments without manual selection.

1. Run the following command, specifying the Target names/UUIDs to delete:

```shell
daytona delete TARGET_1 TARGET_2
```

Upon running this command, Daytona will prompt you to confirm the deletion of the specified Target. You will be able to see the Target name that you are about to delete, and you will have the option to confirm or cancel the action.

```text
Delete target(s): [MyTarget]?
Are you sure you want to delete the target(s): [MyTarget]?

[Yes]   [No]
```

2. Confirm the action to delete the selected Target.

```text
Target MyTarget successfully deleted
```

## Forward Ports from a Target

Daytona supports flexible port forwarding, allowing you to access services running in a Target locally or via a shareable public URL.
With port forwarding, you can work on your project in a Target and test your code externally.

### Access a Port Locally

You can access services running in a Target on your local machine.

**Prerequisite**

- A running Target with at least one service accessible via TCP/UDP.

1. Run the following command to forward a port from a running Target to your local machine:

```shell
daytona forward <PORT> <TARGET> <PROJECT>
```

**Example:** Allow local access to port 4321 of the `example-dev-env` Target.

```shell
daytona forward 4321 example-dev-env
```

Upon running this command, Daytona will establish a port forwarding connection from the specified port in the Target to your local machine. The terminal will display a message indicating the local port where the forwarded connection is available:

```text
Port available at http://localhost:4321
```

### Access a Port via Public URL

You can access services running in a Target via a generated public URL.
This allows you to share your work with others in real-time.

:::note
This feature uses a free public proxy service hosted by Daytona Platforms, Inc.
By using this feature, you acknowledge that your data is processed in accordance with Daytona's [Privacy Policy](https://www.daytona.io/company/privacy-policy) and [Terms of Service](https://www.daytona.io/company/terms-of-service).
:::

**Prerequisite**

- A running Target with at least one service accessible via TCP/UDP.

1. Run the following command to generate a public URL for a port on a running Target:

```shell
daytona forward <PORT> <TARGET> <PROJECT> --public
```

**Example:** Generate a URL to access port 4321 of the `example-dev-env` Target.

```shell
daytona forward 4321 example-dev-env --public
```

Upon running this command, Daytona will first establish a local port forwarding connection and display a message indicating the local port where the forwarded connection is available.

```text
Port available at http://localhost:4321
```

Then, Daytona will proceed to forward the port to a public URL. The terminal will display progress information and, upon completion, provide the generated public URL.

```text
Forwarding port to a public URL...
Port available at:
https://4321-ABC1DeF2GhI3JkLmNoP4RSTuVZ5.try-eu.daytona.app
```

This URL can be shared with others to provide real-time access to the service running on the specified port in your Target.

<Aside type="tip">
Alternatively, generate a public URL by executing the following command in a Target's shell:

```shell
daytona forward <PORT>
```

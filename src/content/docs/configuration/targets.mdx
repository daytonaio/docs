A Target refers to the specific destination or environment where your development setups, facilitated by various [Providers](/configuration/providers), are deployed and managed. Providers define the method and technology used to create your environments, while Targets specify the precise location or platform where these environments will reside.

A Target can be a local machine, a remote server, or a cloud instance, and it can vary based on the chosen Provider. Targets offer the flexibility to deploy and manage environments across different platforms and accounts, all within the unified interface provided by Daytona.

Once you set your Target, it becomes available for selection whenever you create a new development environment in Daytona. You can manage multiple Targets or delete those you no longer need.

## Set a Target

Daytona allows you to set a Target to use when managing Workspaces.

**Prerequisite**

- **At least [one Provider installed](/configuration/providers).**

    Providers are essential for managing and deploying your Workspaces, so make sure you have configured at least one.

1. Run the following command to set a Target:

    ```shell
    daytona target set
    ```

2. Select the appropriate Provider for the environment you want to deploy to.

    ```text
        Choose a provider
        1 item
        ===
        docker-provider
        v0.0.0
    ```

3. Select `New Target`.
4. Enter a name for your Target.
5. Enter the appropriate configuration options when prompted.

    ```text
        Remote Password
        >

        Remote Port
        >

        Remote User
        Note: non-root user required
        >

        Sock Path
        > /var/run/docker.sock

        Workspace Data Dir       
        The directory on the remote host where the workspace data will be stored
        > /tmp/daytona-data

        Remote Private Key Path
        daytona_config
        known_hosts
        Custom path
        None
    ```

6. Click `Enter` to confirm setting the Target.

    ```text
        Target set successfully
     ```

## List Targets

Daytona allows you to keep track of your Targets by listing all previously created Targets with their details.

1. Run the following command to list currently set Targets:

   ```shell
   daytona target list
   ```

   Upon running this command, Daytona will display a list of your Targets with their details. You will be able to see the Target name, the Provider it is connected to, and its configured options.

   ```text
    Target      Provider            Options
    ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    MyTarget    docker-provider     {
                                        "Sock Path": "/var/run/docker.sock"
                                    }
   ```

## Delete a Target

Daytona allows you to delete Targets, helping you manage and remove those that are no longer needed. Once a Target is deleted, you will not be able to manage or deploy Workspaces on that Target.

1. Run the following command:

    ```shell
    daytona target delete
    ```

    Upon running this command, Daytona will display a list of your Targets with their details. You will be able to see the Target name, the unique identifier of the Workspace, and the repository it is connected to.

2. Press `Enter` on the selected Target to delete it.

    ```text
        Choose a Target
        1 item
        ===
        MyTarget          
        docker-provider
    ```

3. Confirm the action.

    ```text
        Delete all workspaces within MyTarget?
        You might not be able to easily remove these workspaces later.
        
        [Yes]     [No]
    ```

    ```text
        Target MyTarget removed successfully
    ```

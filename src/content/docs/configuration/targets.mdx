A Target refers to the specific destination or environment where your development setups, facilitated by various [Providers](/docs/configuration/providers), are deployed and managed. Providers define the method and technology used to create your environments, while Targets specify the precise location or platform where these environments will reside.

A Target can be a local machine, a remote server, or a cloud instance, and it can vary based on the chosen Provider. Targets offer the flexibility to deploy and manage environments across different platforms and accounts, all within the unified interface provided by Daytona.

Once you set your Target, it becomes available for selection whenever you create a new development environment in Daytona. You can manage multiple Targets or delete those you no longer need.

## Set a Target

Daytona allows you to set a Target to use when managing Workspaces.

**Prerequisite**

- **At least [one Provider installed](/docs/configuration/providers).**

    Providers are essential for managing and deploying your Workspaces, so make sure you have configured at least one.

1. Run the following command to set a Target:

```shell
daytona target set
```

2. Select the appropriate Provider for the environment you want to deploy to.

```text
Choose a provider
4 items
===
aws-provider
v0.0.0
digitalocean-provider
v0.0.0
fly-provider
v0.0.0
docker-provider
v0.0.0
```

3. Select **`New Target`**.
4. Enter a name for your Target.

```text
Name
>
```

5. Enter the appropriate configuration options when prompted. The configuration options vary based on the selected Provider. The following example shows setting a [remote Docker Target](#docker-local).

```text
Remote Hostname
>

Remote Password
>

Remote Port
>

Remote User
Note: non-root user required
>

Sock Path
> /var/run/docker.sock

Workspace Data Dir       
The directory on the remote host where the workspace data will be stored
> /tmp/daytona-data

Remote Private Key Path
daytona_config
known_hosts
Custom path
None
```

6. Click **`Enter`** to confirm setting the Target.

```text
Target set successfully
```

:::note
Adding or updating a Target automatically sets it to be the default option for creating workspaces.
Change this by running `daytona target set-default` and selecting the Target you want or override it directly by using the `--target` flag when running `daytona create`.
:::

## List Targets

Daytona allows you to keep track of your Targets by listing all previously created Targets with their details.

1. Run the following command to list currently set Targets:

```shell
daytona target list
```

Upon running this command, Daytona will display a list of your Targets with their details. You will be able to see the Target name, the Provider it is connected to, and its configured options.

```text
Target      Provider            Options
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
MyTarget    docker-provider     {
                                    "Sock Path": "/var/run/docker.sock"
                                }
```

## Delete a Target

Daytona allows you to delete Targets, helping you manage and remove those that are no longer needed. Once a Target is deleted, you will not be able to manage or deploy Workspaces on that Target.

1. Run the following command:

```shell
daytona target delete
```

Upon running this command, Daytona will display a list of your Targets with their details. You will be able to see the Target name, the unique identifier of the Workspace, and the repository it is connected to.

2. Press **`Enter`** on the selected Target to delete it.

```text
Choose a Target
1 item
===
MyTarget          
docker-provider
```

3. Confirm the action.

```text
Delete all workspaces within MyTarget?
You might not be able to easily remove these workspaces later.

[Yes]     [No]
```

```text
Target MyTarget removed successfully
```

## Docker (Local)

Daytona allows you to set a local Docker Target to use for deploying and managing Workspaces. The local Docker Target enables you to deploy Workspaces on your local machine using Docker.

:::note

Container registries store credentials used to pull container images from specified registry servers. Adding container registry credentials is useful for users who want to create Workspaces from private images and those hosted on private registries.

Container registries are managed through environment variables, enabling you to securely store and manage credentials. Daytona provides options to set, list, and delete container registries for your Workspaces.

Daytona provides options to set global environment variables that apply to all Workspaces or set environment variables for a specific Workspace. To set environment variables for a specific Workspace, use the `--env` flag when creating a new Workspace, or configure the environment variables in the Workspace's template. For server-wide environment variables that apply to all new Workspaces, use the `daytona env` command.

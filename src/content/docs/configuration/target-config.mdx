A Target Configuration refers to the specific destination or environment where your development setup, facilitated by various [Providers](/docs/configuration/providers), is deployed and managed. Providers define the method and technology used to create your environments, while Targets Configurations specify the precise location or platform where these environments will reside.

A Target Configuration can be a local machine, a remote server, or a cloud instance, and it can vary based on the chosen Provider. Target Configurations offer the flexibility to deploy and manage environments across different platforms and accounts, all within the unified interface provided by Daytona.

Once you add your Target Configuration, it becomes available for selection whenever you create a new development environment in Daytona. You can create multiple Target Configurations, list existing ones, or delete those you no longer need.

## Create a Target Configuration

Daytona provides an option to create a Target Configuration to use when managing Workspaces.

1. Run the following command to create a Target Configuration:

```shell
daytona target-config create
```

2. Select the appropriate Provider for the environment you want to deploy to.

```text

```

3. Enter a name for your Target Configuration.

```text
Target Config Name
>
```

4. Enter the appropriate configuration options when prompted. The configuration options vary based on the selected Provider. The following example shows adding a [remote Docker Target Configuration](#docker-remote).

```text
Remote Hostname

Custom path
None
```

5. Click **`Enter`** to confirm adding the Target Configuration.

```text

```

## List Target Configurations

Daytona provides an option to keep track of your Target Configurations by listing all previously created Target Configurations with their details.

1. Run the following command to list currently set Target Configurations:

```shell
daytona target-config list
```

Upon running this command, Daytona will display a list of your Target Configurations with their details. You will be able to see the Target Configuration name, the Provider it is connected to, and its configured Runner.

```text
Target            Provider                Runner
────────────────────────────────────────────────
local             docker-provider         local
```

## Delete a Target Configuration

Daytona provides an option to delete Target Configurations, helping you manage and remove those that are no longer needed. Once a Target Configuration is deleted, you will not be able to manage or deploy Workspaces on that Target Configuration.

1. Run the following command to delete a Target Configuration:

```shell
daytona target-config delete
```

Upon running this command, Daytona will display a list of your Target Configurations with their details. You will be able to see the Configuration name, the unique identifier of the Workspace, and the repository it is connected to.

2. Press **`Enter`** on the selected Configuration to delete it.

```text
Choose a Target Config To Delete
1 item
===
MyTarget          
docker-provider
```

3. Click **`Yes`** to confirm deleting the Target Configuration.

```text
Delete all workspaces within MyTarget?
You might not be able to easily remove these workspaces later.

[Yes]     [No]
```

```text
Target Config MyTarget removed successfully
```

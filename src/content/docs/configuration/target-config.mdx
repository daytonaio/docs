A Target Configuration refers to the specific destination or environment where your development setup, facilitated by various [Providers](/docs/configuration/providers), is deployed and managed. Providers define the method and technology used to create your environments, while Targets Configurations specify the precise location or platform where these environments will reside.

A Target Configuration can be a local machine, a remote server, or a cloud instance, and it can vary based on the chosen Provider. Target Configurations offer the flexibility to deploy and manage environments across different platforms and accounts, all within the unified interface provided by Daytona.

Once you set your Target Configuration, it becomes available for selection whenever you create a new development environment in Daytona. You can manage multiple Target Configurations or delete those you no longer need.

## Set a Target Configuration

Daytona provides an option to set a Target Configuration to use when managing Workspaces.

**Prerequisite**

- **At least [one Provider installed](/docs/configuration/providers).**

    Providers are essential for managing and deploying your Workspaces, so make sure you have configured at least one.

1. Run the following command to set a Target Configuration:

```shell
daytona target-config set
```

2. Select the appropriate Provider for the environment you want to deploy to.

```text
Choose a provider
4 items
===
aws-provider
v0.0.0
digitalocean-provider
v0.0.0
fly-provider
v0.0.0
docker-provider
v0.0.0
```

3. Select **`New Target`**.
4. Enter a name for your Target Configuration.

```text
Name
>
```

5. Enter the appropriate configuration options when prompted. The configuration options vary based on the selected Provider. The following example shows setting a [remote Docker Target Configuration](#docker-local).

```text
Remote Hostname
>

Remote Password
>

Remote Port
>

Remote User
Note: non-root user required
>

Sock Path
> /var/run/docker.sock

Workspace Data Dir       
The directory on the remote host where the workspace data will be stored
> /tmp/daytona-data

Remote Private Key Path
daytona_config
known_hosts
Custom path
None
```

6. Click **`Enter`** to confirm setting the Target Configuration.

```text
Target set successfully
```

:::note
Adding or updating a Target Configuration automatically sets it to be the default option for creating workspaces.
Change this by running `daytona target-config set-default` and selecting the Target Configuration you want or override it directly by using the `--target-config` flag when running `daytona create`.
:::

## List Target Configurations

Daytona provides an option to keep track of your Target Configurations by listing all previously created Target Configurations with their details.

1. Run the following command to list currently set Target Configurations:

```shell
daytona target-config list
```

Upon running this command, Daytona will display a list of your Target Configurations with their details. You will be able to see the Target Configuration name, the Provider it is connected to, and its configured options.

```text
Target      Provider            Options
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
MyTarget    docker-provider     {
                                    "Sock Path": "/var/run/docker.sock"
                                }
```

## Delete a Target Configuration

Daytona provides an option to delete Target Configurations, helping you manage and remove those that are no longer needed. Once a Target Configuration is deleted, you will not be able to manage or deploy Workspaces on that Target Configuration.

1. Run the following command:

```shell
daytona target-config delete
```

Upon running this command, Daytona will display a list of your Target Configurations with their details. You will be able to see the Configuration name, the unique identifier of the Workspace, and the repository it is connected to.

2. Press **`Enter`** on the selected Configuration to delete it.

```text
Choose a Target
1 item
===
MyTarget          
docker-provider
```

3. Confirm the action.

```text
Delete all workspaces within MyTarget?
You might not be able to easily remove these workspaces later.

[Yes]     [No]
```

```text
Target MyTarget removed successfully
```

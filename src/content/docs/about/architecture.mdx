## Open Source

Daytona Open Source includes the [Daytona API](/docs/tools/api), which serves as the central interface for programmatically interacting with Daytona. The Open Source version provides a comprehensive set of features and tools to manage development environments, including [Interfaces](#interfaces), [Git Providers](#git-providers), [Container Registries](#container-registries), [Providers](#providers), and [Targets](#targets).

### Interfaces

Daytona Open Source offers a variety of [Interfaces](/docs/usage/ide) to interact with the platform and manage development environments. Interfaces provide different ways to interact with Daytona, enabling developers to choose the most suitable method based on their preferences and workflows.

These include the [Command Line Interface (CLI)](/docs/tools/cli) for direct control, [IDEs](/docs/usage/ide) such as [Visual Studio Code (VSCode)](/docs/usage/ide#vs-code), [Jupyter](/docs/usage/ide#jupyter), [Zed](/docs/usage/ide#zed), [Cursor](/docs/usage/ide#cursor), JetBrains IDEs for integrated development, and [Terminal SSH](/docs/usage/ide#terminal-ssh).

Additionally, Daytona SDK is provided to enable developers to create custom integrations and extend platform functionality.

### Git Providers

Daytona Open Source integrates Git Providers to manage version control operations and interact with Git repositories. Git Providers enable efficient source code management and synchronization with Workspaces.

Supported Git Providers include [GitHub](/docs/configuration/git-providers#github), [GitLab](/docs/configuration/git-providers#gitlab), [Bitbucket](/docs/configuration/git-providers#bitbucket), [GitHub Enterprise Server](/docs/configuration/git-providers#github-enterprise-server), [GitLab Self-Managed](/docs/configuration/git-providers#gitlab-self-managed), [Bitbucket Server](/docs/configuration/git-providers#bitbucket-server), [Codeberg](/docs/configuration/git-providers#codeberg), [Gitea](/docs/configuration/git-providers#gitea), [Gitness](/docs/configuration/git-providers#gitness), [Azure DevOps](/docs/configuration/git-providers#azure-devops), [AWS CodeCommit](/docs/configuration/git-providers#aws-codecommit), [Gogs](/docs/configuration/git-providers#gogs), and [Gitee](/docs/configuration/git-providers#gitee).

The Git Providers integration facilitates collaborative development workflows and streamlines the connection between repositories and development environments.

### Container Registries

Daytona Open Source provides Container Registries to store credentials used to pull container images from specified registry servers. Daytona's architecture allows you to configure multiple container registries. This allows you to use different registries for different environments, such as development, testing, and production.

Supported Container Registries include Google Container Registry, Azure Container Registry, Amazon Elastic Container Registry, Docker Hub, and others.

### Providers

Daytona Open Source uses Providers to enable integration with various technologies to create and manage development environments. Providers abstract complexities of underlying technologies and serve as the foundational engines that Daytona leverages to deploy and run your environments.

Supported Providers include [Docker](/docs/configuration/providers#docker), [DigitalOcean](/docs/configuration/providers#digitalocean), [AWS](/docs/configuration/providers#aws), [Azure](/docs/configuration/providers#azure), [GCP](/docs/configuration/providers#gcp), [Hetzner](/docs/configuration/providers#hetzner), and [Fly](/docs/configuration/providers#fly).

### Targets

[Targets](/docs/configuration/targets) represent isolated processing units where Workspaces are executed. They can operate on various infrastructures, including cloud-based and on-premises environments. Targets provide the necessary compute resources and meet security requirements within the defined infrastructure.

Daytona supports a variety of Targets, including [Docker (Local)](/docs/configuration/targets#docker), [Docker (Remote)](/docs/configuration/targets#docker), [DigitalOcean](/docs/configuration/targets#digitalocean), [AWS](/docs/configuration/targets#aws), [Azure](/docs/configuration/targets#azure), [GCP](/docs/configuration/targets#gcp), [Hetzner](/docs/configuration/targets#hetzner), and [Fly](/docs/configuration/targets#fly).

## Enterprise

The Enterprise edition of Daytona extends the capabilities of the Open Source version with additional features and services tailored for enterprise-grade development environments. These enhancements include advanced security, authentication, and authorization mechanisms, as well as observability and resource management tools to optimize workspace performance and utilization.

### Dashboard

The Enterprise version introduces a Dashboard, which provides a centralized interface for managing and monitoring the platform, improving visibility and control over development environments.

### Authentication

Authentication features support Single Sign-On (SSO) and standards such as Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) and
System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM), ensuring secure access to the platform. This enables seamless integration with enterprise identity systems and simplifies user management.

### Authorization

Authorization capabilities allow for granular control of access and permissions across users, teams, organizations, and projects. This ensures secure collaboration and adherence to organizational policies by providing role-based access management.

### Observability

Observability tools offer enhanced monitoring, logging, and tracing capabilities for Workspaces and development activities. This ensures that teams can track system performance, debug issues effectively, and maintain operational insights into their environments.

### Resource Management

Resource Management is expanded with enterprise features, enhancing workspace classes and quota management to meet large-scale, organization-wide requirements.

### Identity Providers

The Enterprise version integrates with Identity Providers (IDP) to enhance authentication and identity management. Supported IDPs include EntraID, Cognito, Okta, OpenID, Google, and others. These integrations ensure that enterprises can use their existing identity systems to manage user authentication, enabling secure and compliant access to the platform.

### Security

Daytona Enterprise enhances security by integrating with advanced security tools and services. These include JFrog, Snyk, Sonatype, and more, ensuring that vulnerabilities in dependencies and containerized environments are identified and mitigated. These security integrations provide automated scanning, reporting, and remediation, reinforcing the integrity of development workflows and applications.

## Adding a Git Provider

To interact with Git repositories and manage version control operations, you can add a [Git Provider](/configuration/git-providers) to Daytona. This step is essential for cloning repositories, pushing changes, and managing your codebase effectively.

Daytona supports a wide range of Git Providers, including popular platforms like [GitHub](/configuration/git-providers#github), [GitLab](/configuration/git-providers#gitlab), and [Bitbucket](/configuration/git-providers#bitbucket), as well as self-hosted solutions. Integrating a Git Provider with Daytona allows you to manage your repositories directly within the platform, eliminating the need for repeated authentication.

## Installing a Provider

[Provider](/configuration/providers) is a plugin that interfaces with the [Daytona Server](/usage/server), handling development environment deployment and lifecycle management.

Daytona supports a variety of Providers, allowing you to integrate with different platforms based on your needs. Once installed, a Provider will manage the deployment of your development environment directly within Daytona, ensuring integration with your chosen platform.

For more details on available Providers and related commands, use the `daytona provider` command to explore options and manage your configurations.

</DocumentList>

## Setting a Target

Once you have installed a Provider, you can set a [Target](/configuration/providers#add-a-target) to define how Daytona manages and deploys your development environment. Configuring a Target allows you to tailor the development environment for your projects.

A Target is a configuration that specifies where and how your development environment will be deployed. It is associated with a Provider and includes all the details Daytona needs to create and manage your development environment in a specific location, such as a local machine, cloud server, or remote Docker instance.

Once your Target is set, Daytona will use it whenever you create a new development environment. You can manage multiple Targets, switch between them, or delete those you no longer need.

For more details on available Providers and related commands, use the `daytona target` command to explore options and manage your configurations.

## Choosing the Default IDE

Daytona allows you to connect to your development environment using a variety of [IDEs](/usage/ide), including popular options like [Visual Studio Code (VSCode)](/usage/ide#vs-code), JetBrains IDEs, and [Terminal SSH](/usage/ide#terminal-ssh). By setting the default IDE, you can automatically open your development environment in your preferred environment, streamlining your workflow and reducing setup time.

## Creating your Workspace

Once you have completed the initial setup and configuration steps, you can [create your Workspace](/usage/workspaces#create-a-workspace) using Daytona. A Workspace represents an isolated development environment where you can manage your code, build projects, and collaborate with team members.

Creating a Workspace involves defining the necessary configurations, such as the Git repository URL and selecting the appropriate [Git Provider](/configuration/git-providers). Daytona simplifies this process by providing a user-friendly interface to set up and manage your Workspaces efficiently.

To create a Workspace, use the `daytona create` command and follow the prompts to configure your Workspace settings. Once created, you can access your Workspace and interact with your codebase.

## Selecting a Builder

Daytona allows you to control how your development environment is built by selecting a [Builder](/usage/builders). A Builder is responsible for creating a container image with all the tools, dependencies, and configurations needed for your development environment.

When setting up your Workspace, you can choose from the following Builder options:

- [Automatic](/usage/builders#automatic-builder) auto-detects and uses the most appropriate Builder based on your project.

- [Dev Container](/usage/builders#dev-container-builder) builds the development environment image using a Dev Container configuration located in your repository.

- [Custom Image](/usage/builders#custom-image-builder) allows you to specify a custom container image to build your development environment.

- [None](/usage/builders#none) uses Daytona's default base image to build the development environment.

To select a Builder, use the appropriate flags during the [Workspace creation process](/usage/workspaces#create-a-workspace). This flexibility ensures your environment is tailored to meet your development environment's specific needs.

## Configuring Daytona Server

The [Daytona Server](/usage/server) is a crucial component that runs as a daemon on your machine, responsible for managing [Workspaces](/usage/workspaces), [Providers](/configuration/providers), and other system configurations. The Daytona Server provides a centralized interface for interacting with the Daytona platform, allowing you to manage your development environments. The Daytona Server can be easily managed by using the [Daytona CLI](/reference/cli).

Daytona offers flexible configuration options for the server. The configuration file, which contains settings such as the server ID, API port, and default project image, is located in different directories depending on your operating system:

- On macOS, the configuration file is located at:

    `~/Library/Application\ Support/daytona/server/config.json`.

- On Linux, the configuration file is located at:

    `~/.config/daytona/server/config.json`.

- On Windows, the configuration file is located at:

    `C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\daytona\server\config.json`.

To view the Daytona Server configuration, use the `daytona server config` command. This command displays the server configuration properties, allowing you to manage and customize the server settings as needed.

Daytona allows you to edit the server configuration directly by using the `daytona server configure` command. This command opens the configuration file, enabling you to modify the server settings based on your requirements.

## Using the CLI

The Daytona Command-Line Interface (CLI) is the primary method of interacting with the Daytona platform. The CLI provides a comprehensive set of commands that allow you to manage Workspaces, Providers, and other system configurations.

To access the Daytona CLI, open your terminal and use the `daytona` command followed by the desired subcommand. The CLI offers a wide range of commands, each serving a specific purpose, such as creating Workspaces, managing Providers, setting Targets, and configuring system settings.

For a complete list of available commands and their descriptions, refer to the [CLI Reference](/reference/cli). This reference guide provides detailed information on each command, including usage examples and command options, helping you leverage the full potential of the Daytona CLI.

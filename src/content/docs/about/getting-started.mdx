Once you have completed the installation, you will be ready to start using Daytona to manage and develop your development environments. If you encounter any issues during installation, consult by reaching out to Daytona's [Slack community](https://go.daytona.io/slack) for assistance.

## Using the CLI

The Daytona Command-Line Interface (CLI) is the primary method of interacting with the Daytona platform. The CLI provides a comprehensive set of commands that allow you to manage Workspaces, Providers, and other system configurations.

To access the Daytona CLI, open your terminal and use the `daytona` command followed by the desired subcommand. The CLI offers a wide range of commands, each serving a specific purpose, such as creating Workspaces, managing Providers, setting Targets, and configuring system settings.

For a complete list of available commands and their descriptions, refer to the [CLI Reference](/reference/cli). This reference guide provides detailed information on each command, including usage examples and command options, helping you leverage the full potential of the Daytona CLI.

Additionally, you can use the `daytona --help` command to list all commands, offering a convenient way to explore available options.

## Adding a Git Provider

You can integrate Daytona with a [Git Provider](/configuration/git-providers) to manage version control operations and interact with your Git repositories.

Daytona supports a variety of Git Providers, including [GitHub](/configuration/git-providers#github), [GitLab](/configuration/git-providers#gitlab), [Bitbucket](/configuration/git-providers#bitbucket), [GitHub Enterprise Server](/configuration/git-providers#github-enterprise-server), [GitLab Self-Managed](/configuration/git-providers#gitlab-self-managed), [Bitbucket Server](/configuration/git-providers#bitbucket-server), [Codeberg](/configuration/git-providers#codeberg), [Gitea](/configuration/git-providers#gitea), [Gitness](/configuration/git-providers#gitness), [Azure DevOps](/configuration/git-providers#azure-devops), and [AWS CodeCommit](/configuration/git-providers#aws-codecommit).

This integration supports and enables interacting with your codebase, cloning repositories, and pushing changes directly from Daytona.

## Installing a Provider

[Providers](/configuration/providers) are plugins through which Daytona integrates with various technologies to create and manage development environments. Providers abstract complexities of underlying technologies and serve as the foundational engines that Daytona leverages to deploy and run your environments, whether through containerization, orchestration, or cloud-based virtual machines.

By default, a Docker Provider is configured with `localhost` as the Target.

1. Run the following command to install a Provider:

  ```shell
  daytona provider install
  ```

2. Select the Docker Provider you want to install from the list.

  ```text
  Choose a provider to install
  1 item
  ===
  docker-provider
  v0.0.0
  ```

Upon selecting the Provider, Daytona will install and configure the chosen Provider, making it available for managing and deploying development environments.

```text
Provider docker-provider has been successfully installed
```

If this configuration meets your requirements, you can proceed with [setting a Target](#setting-a-target).

You can install additional Providers to extend Daytona's capabilities and support a wide range of container management platforms and cloud hosting services.

Follow the instructions provided in the [Providers installation](/configuration/providers) guide to install and manage a Provider. The guide includes detailed steps for installing Providers for various container management platforms and cloud hosting services.

## Setting a Target

A [Target](/configuration/targets) refers to the specific destination or environment where your development setups, facilitated by various Providers, are deployed and managed. Providers define the method and technology used to create your environments, while Targets specify the precise location or platform where these environments will reside.

A Target can be a local machine, a remote server, or a cloud instance, and it can vary based on the chosen Provider. Targets offer the flexibility to deploy and manage environments across different platforms and accounts, all within the unified interface provided by Daytona.

Once you set your Target, it becomes available for selection whenever you create a new development environment in Daytona. You can manage multiple Targets or delete those you no longer need.

Follow the instructions provided in the [managing Targets](/configuration/targets) guide to set a Target and configure your development environment deployment settings.

Use the `daytona target --help` command to view available configuration options for setting a Target.

## Choosing the Default IDE

Daytona allows you to connect to your development environment using a variety of [IDEs](/usage/ide), including popular options like [Visual Studio Code (VSCode)](/usage/ide#vs-code), JetBrains IDEs, and [Terminal SSH](/usage/ide#terminal-ssh).

By setting the default IDE, you can automatically open your development environment in your preferred environment, optimizing your workflow and reducing setup time.

## Creating your Workspace

Once you have completed the initial setup and configuration steps, you can [create your Workspace](/usage/workspaces#create-a-workspace) using Daytona. A Workspace represents an isolated development environment where you can manage your code, build projects, and collaborate with team members.

Creating a Workspace involves defining the necessary configurations, such as selecting the appropriate [Git Provider](/configuration/git-providers) or entering the Git repository URL. Daytona simplifies this process by providing a user-friendly interface to set up and manage your Workspaces.

To create a Workspace, use the `daytona create` command and follow the prompts to configure your Workspace settings. Once created, you can access your Workspace and interact with your codebase.

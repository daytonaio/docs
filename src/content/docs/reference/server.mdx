The Daytona Server is a daemon that runs on your machine and handles actions relating to Development Environments.
The primary method of interacting with the server is through the Daytona CLI, although it's possible to interact manually using a HTTP interface.


## Configuring the Server
The server configuration is located in different directories depending on your operating system.
The configuration can be viewed using the `daytona server config` command across all operating systems.

Server configuration can be manually edited by using the `daytona server configure` command.

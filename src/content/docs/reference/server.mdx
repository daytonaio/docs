The Daytona Server is a daemon that runs on your machine and handles actions relating to Development Environments.
The primary method of interacting with the server is through the Daytona CLI, although it's possible to interact manually using a HTTP interface.

## Configuration
Daytona's server configuration is located in the following locations depending on your operating system:
*   macOS: `~/Library/Application\ Support/daytona/server/config.json`
*   Linux: `~/.config/daytona/server/config.json`
*   Windows: `C:\Users\<YOUR_USERNAME>\AppData\Roaming\daytona\server\config.json`

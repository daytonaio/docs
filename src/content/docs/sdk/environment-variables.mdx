title: Environment Variables
---

Daytona SDK provides an option to set environment variables for Workspaces, which can be used to configure applications, set sensitive data, or define runtime behavior.

### Setting Environment Variables

Daytona SDK provides an option to set environment variables during Workspace creation or update them later. You can set environment variables as key-value pairs to configure applications, set sensitive data, or define runtime behavior.

#### Python

```python
# Set environment variables during creation
workspace = daytona.create(
    env={
        "DEBUG": "true",
        "API_KEY": "secret"
    }
)

# Update environment variables
workspace.set_env({
    "NEW_VAR": "value"
})
```

#### TypeScript

```typescript
// Set environment variables during creation
const workspace = await daytona.create({
    env: {
        DEBUG: 'true',
        API_KEY: 'secret'
    }
});

// Update environment variables
await workspace.setEnv({
    NEW_VAR: 'value'
});
```

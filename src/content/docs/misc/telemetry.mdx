  Distribution: **Open Source**, **Self-Managed**

All telemetry data is **completely anonymous** and **does not** include any personally identifiable information (PII) or user secrets.
Participation is optional and you may opt-out at any time.

## The Goal

The goal of gathering telemetry data in the CLI is exclusively for the purpose of improving the Daytona ecosystem.
Data gathered from the CLI will allow us to gain more insights into the usage of the binary, help us track errors and improve user experience.

The data **does** include:

- **CLI command usage**

  This includes the name of the command that was run, how it was called (e.g., was an alias used?),
  the source (e.g., local CLI or inside of a project), the version of the binary, and the execution time.

- **API server request and response data**

  In the request and response payloads, only public data is included.
  This data may include any public git repositories used to create workspaces and any public container images used to create workspaces.

  The data also includes the path of the request, with URL parameters that might include PII stripped (e.g., URI: `/workspace/:workspaceId/:projectName/state` is provided as is,
  with `workspaceId` and `projectName` not provided to the telemetry service).
  Additionally, the request method, binary version, query, and source are gathered.

- **Relevant server events**

  Currently, only workspace lifecycle events are gathered (creation, stop, start, delete, etc.), but this might be expanded in the future.

The data **does not** include:

- **CLI command arguments**

  Arguments might contain PII or user secrets, so they are left out.

- **Full API request and response payloads**

  Payloads may contain PII or user secrets, so only public data is shared with the telemetry collection service.

- **Environment variables**

  Any environment variables set on projects created by the user, including Daytona-set environment variables, are not included.

- **Geolocation information and IP address**

  No geolocation information about the user or their IP address is included.

## Gathering Policy

Telemetry gathering in the CLI is **opt-out**. This means that telemetry data is gathered by default because it does not include any PII.

- To disable telemetry, users can run `daytona telemetry disable`.

- To enable telemetry, users can run `daytona telemetry enable`.

## CLI Identifier

All telemetry events contain a unique identifier. The ID is set in the CLI configuration.
The purpose of this identifier is to provide a way to aggregate telemetry data from the same CLI across different sessions and workspaces.
This means that the CLI ID is shared between the CLI and any workspaces the user might create.

## Data Protection

We use <a href="https://posthog.com/" target="_blank">Posthog</a> as our Telemetry service of choice.
The data is stored in the EU under the Daytona organization account.
The data is available only to a subset of Daytona maintainers and is only used for the purpose of improving the Daytona ecosystem.
The telemetry data that we track has never and will never be sold or monetized in any form.

## Debugging

Telemetry events can be debugged by setting `LOG_LEVEL=trace` which will output information about the telemetry event queue.

Images are pre-configured templates containing all dependencies, tools and environment settings you need inside of your Daytona Sandbox. Daytona supports all standard [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) or [OCI](https://opencontainers.org/) compatible images.

## Creating Images

When spinning up a Sandbox, Daytona uses a simple image with some useful utilities pre-installed, such as `python`, `node`, `pip` as well as some common pip packages. More information [below](#default-image).

It is possible to override this behavior and create custom Images by visiting the Dashboard, clicking on [Images](https://app.daytona.io/dashboard/images) and on `Create Image`.

You may enter the name and tag of any publicly accessible image from Docker Hub such as `alpine:3.21.3` and `debian:12.10` or from another public container registry - e.g. `my-public-registry.com/custom-alpine:3.21`.

The entrypoint field is optional and if your image hasn't got a long-running entrypoint, Daytona will ensure sure that the resulting container won't exit immediately upon creation by automatically running `sleep infinity`.

:::note
Since images tagged `latest` get frequent updates, only specific tags (e.g. `0.1.0`) are supported. Same idea applies to tags such as `lts` or `stable` and we recommend avoiding those when defining an image.
:::

Once the image is pulled, validated and has an `Active` state, it is ready to be used. Define the `CreateSandboxParams` object to specify the custom image to use:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Python" icon="seti:python">
```bash
params = CreateSandboxParams(image="alpine:3.21.3", language="python")
sandbox = daytona.create(params)
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="TypeScript" icon="seti:typescript">
```bash
const sandbox = await daytona.create({
  language: 'python',
  image: 'alpine:3.21.3',
})
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Full example:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Python" icon="seti:python">
```python
from daytona import Daytona, CreateSandboxParams

daytona = Daytona()

sandbox = daytona.create(CreateSandboxParams(
  image="alpine:3.21.3",
  language="python"
))

response = sandbox.process.code_run('print("Sum of 3 and 4 is " + str(3 + 4))')
if response.exit_code != 0:
    print(f"Error running code: {response.exit_code} {response.result}")
else:
    print(response.result)

daytona.remove(sandbox)

```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="TypeScript" icon="seti:typescript">
```typescript
import { Daytona } from '@daytonaio/sdk'

async function main() {
  // Initialize the Daytona client
  const daytona = new Daytona()

  try {
    // Create the Sandbox instance
    const sandbox = await daytona.create({
      language: 'python',
      image: 'alpine:3.21.3',
    })
    // Run the code securely inside the Sandbox
    const response = await sandbox.process.codeRun(
      'print("Sum of 3 and 4 is " + str(3 + 4))',
    )
    if (response.exitCode !== 0) {
      console.error('Error running code:', response.exitCode, response.result)
    } else {
      console.log(response.result)
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Sandbox flow error:', error)
  } finally {
    // Clean up the Sandbox
    await daytona.remove(sandbox)
  }
}

main()

```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Images from Private Registries

To use an Image that is not publicly available, you need to start by adding the image's private Container Registry:

1. Go to the [Registries](https://app.daytona.io/dashboard/registries) page in the Dashboard
2. Click the `Add Registry` button.
3. Input the Registry's name and URL, username, password, project, and submit
4. Once the Container Registry is created, you may go back to the [Images](https://app.daytona.io/dashboard/images) page
5. When creating a new private Image, make sure to input the entire Image name, including the registry location and project name - `my-private-registry.com/<my-project>/custom-alpine:3.21`

The next step is the same; simply set the `CreateSandboxParams` field to use the full image name and no more authentication is needed.

## Using a Local Image

In order to avoid having to manually set up a private container registry and push your image there, the [Daytona CLI](/docs/getting-started#setting-up-the-daytona-cli) allows you to push an image from your local device or from a local Dockerfile and use it in your Sandboxes.

After running `docker images` and ensuring the image and tag you want to use is available use the `daytona image push` command to add the image to Daytona, e.g.:

```bash
daytona image push custom-alpine:3.21
```

If you haven't built the desired image yet, you can use the `--dockerfile` flag to pass the path to the Dockerfile you want to use and let the CLI do the rest:

```bash
daytona image push trying-daytona:0.0.1 --dockerfile ./Dockerfile
```

```text
Building image from /Users/idagelic/docs/Dockerfile
Step 1/5 : FROM alpine:latest

...

 Successfully pushed dfile-try:0.1.0 to Daytona                                         
                                          
 ⡿  Waiting for the image be validated ...

 ...

 ✓  Use 'harbor-transient.internal.daytona.app/daytona/dfile-try:0.1.0' to create a new sandbox using this image

```

This approach also ensures that the resulting image is for the AMD architecture which is the architecture we use when spinning up Daytona Sandboxes.

## Deleting Images

Deleting your custom Images is a straightforward process. Simply go to the [Images](https://app.daytona.io/dashboard/images) page and click on the `Delete` button that shows up when clicking the three dots at the end of a row of the Image you want removed.

:::tip

To temporarily disable an image, instead of deleting, you can click `Disable`. This will prevent the image from being used in any new Sandboxes but will not delete it.
